  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is significant interest throughout the United States in performing a well-designed
      study to evaluate whether there is value in using Hydroxychloroquine or Chloroquine as a
      pre-exposure prophylaxis or post-exposure prophylaxis regimen for COVID-19 patients and at
      risk personnel.

      We have designed a prospective double blinded randomized controlled clinical trial to answer
      just this question.

      The study will consist of 4 arms:

        1. A placebo control arm of 450 patients

        2. A low dose prophylaxis arm of 450 patients treated with 200mg Hydroxychloroquine daily

        3. A high dose prophylaxis arm of 450 patients treated with 400mg Hydroxychloroquine daily

        4. A post-exposure arm of 100 patients treated with 400mg Hydroxychloroquine daily for 7
           days.

    <textblock>
      Since December of 2019 COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading virus presently infecting over
      1,000,000 individuals worldwide, over 250,000, and over 6,000 deaths in the United States as
      of 03/31/2020.1

      Presently there are no FDA approved treatments or immunizations against COVID-19; however,
      the FDA has granted an EUA for the treatment of hospitalized patients with
      hydroxycholorquine.2

      Depending on case series the expected case fatality rate for COVID-19 without treatment is
      between 0.5-10% with the most likely range between 1-3% which is &gt;10x the expected case
      fatality rate of seasonal influenza.

      Several studies have reported anecdotal and promising preliminary data on the treatment of
      Coronavirus. Based on the limited evidence from these studies, pre-exposure prophylaxis, or
      post-exposure prophylaxis may be beneficial.3-21

      Due to the nature of the work in the Pentagon multiple critical individuals are unable to
      practice effective social distancing measures in order to ensure their mission critical jobs
      for continuity of government and national defense.

      Any medication, treatment protocol, or epidemiological control measure which appears safe
      preliminarily and can be implemented must be tested and put into practice immediately in
      order to protect senior leaders and other mission critical personnel.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether pre-exposure prophylaxis decreases the
      incidence of COVID-19 infections amongst personnel, and the secondary aim is to determine
      whether post-exposure prophylaxis decreases the severity of illness and speeds the return to
      work of personnel.

      The Pentagon Medical Facilities consist of 2 separate medical clinics and 2 separate dental
      clinics that collaborate on daily activities. Operational personnel with special medical
      requirements such as aviators and Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) personnel are typically
      seen in the Pentagon Flight Medicine Clinic while other personnel are seen in the DiLorenzo
      Tricare Health Clinic Pentagon.

      Based on the EUAs for hydroxychloroquine &amp; chloroquine, which are in critical national
      shortage, and inpatient treatment protocols, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine show
      potential for treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. We suspect that treatment of
      early or asymptomatic exposed patients with chloroquine may decrease infection rates or limit
      infection severity if pre-treated or treated early

      Describe all the data variables, information to be collected, the source of the data, and how
      the data will be operationally measured.

      Study Procedures:

      Inclusion criteria:

      All mission critical personnel enrolled to the DiLorenzo Tricare Health Clinic or Pentagon
      Flight Medicine Clinic unable to telework or appropriately socially distance with access to
      the Pentagon during the declared public health crisis.

      Exclusion criteria:

      Known recovered COVID-19 patient, G6PD deficient individuals, individuals with significant QT
      abnormalities, non-compliant patients, and patients who refuse randomization or consent.

      Recruitment by Arms:

        1. 2, 3. Individuals will be approached by protocol staff and any other staff added to the
           protocol after initial submission during their screening for clinical visits or access
           screening to critical spaces. They will be asked 2 questions:

           a. Are you aware of an ongoing study within the Pentagon attempting to determine the
           efficacy of a medication to prevent or treat COVID-19 infections?

           i. If the individual answers yes:

           a. Have you already elected or are you interested in participating?

           i. If yes they are or are interested in participating they will be referred for
           enrollment as appropriate.

           ii. If not they will be thanked for their time.

           ii. If the individual answers no:

           a. Would you like to learn more or are you interested in enrolling?

           i. Yes: Referred for enrollment.

           ii. No: They will be thanked for their time.

      4. PIs and AIs who are seeing patients for possible COVID-19 exposure or who have tested
      positive as part of their routine clinical duties will offer enrollment to arm 4 these
      individuals. At their first visit.

      Consent:

      Informed and appropriately witnessed consent* as required will be obtained by the PI or any
      other AI added in subsequent modifications to the protocol. Due to telemedicine and social
      distancing with the ongoing crisis this will be by distance mechanisms including digital
      versus wet signature as clinically indicated based on the situation to minimize patient and
      provider risks.

      Patients will be assigned sequential patient identifier numbers during their consent process
      for tracking purposes.

      Initial procedures for safety monitoring including CBC, CMP, UA, G6PD testing (if prior
      records unavailable), and EKG (if prior records unavailable) will be obtained after consent.

      Assignment to groups 1, 2, or 3:

      Patients will be randomized to groups 1-3 by a random number generators' results
      (https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03SHGo_yHevMbw4jIPVd85kc7e8Sg%3A1586372945822&amp;sourc

      BAzcuM5gBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXo&amp;sclient=psy-ab) pre-recorded in a sealed plain envelope.

      Medication retrieval:

      The patient will then present to the DTHC pharmacy with their envelope and copy of their
      enrollment consent to retrieve their medications. The pharmacist will open their envelope and
      hand them medication 1, 2, or 3 as appropriate, and record their study number and group
      number on a running spreadsheet maintained without PII in the pharmacy.

      Patients will provide their study number to the pharmacy for any refills during the duration
      of the study.

      If an individual is on pre-exposure prophylaxis and develops COVID-19 they will continue on
      treatment through the post-exposure prophylaxis window of 7 days on the dose they were
      assigned at randomization.

      Records collection:

      Patient records will be queried in five ways: 1. At study enrollment 2. During consent
      patient's will be asked to inform study personnel if they become sick or exposed to COVID-19;
      patients will present with concerns 3. Monthly records reviews will be conducted to determine
      if patients have become positive or are displaying signs of COVID-19 4. When the study
      personnel are informed by public health officials of a positive COVID-19 patient assigned to
      the Pentagon 5. When the declared public health emergency is over or the study ends (at its 1
      year anniversary if the public health emergency has not ended).

      Results will be retrieved from AHTLA, CHCS, request to treating civilian providers for care
      outside the MHS, Essentris, and MHS imaging systems such as Impax.

      Records collection will include as appropriate:

        1. Date of exposure - to determine optimal timing of post-exposure prophylaxis during data
           analysis.

        2. Date of positive test - to determine optimal timing of post-exposure prophylaxis on data
           analysis.

        3. Medical comorbidities as they are known or become known including HTN, DM, Male Gender,
           Age, Pulmonary Disease, Health Care Worker / First Responder, and/or known cardiac
           disease. - to control and test for cofounding conditions as well as risk stratify

        4. CXR results, Chest CT results, Intracranial Imaging results, cardiac testing, CBCs,
           CMPs, COVID-19 test results, Infectious Disease notes, Pulmonary notes,
           Cardiology/Cardiac surgery notes, and Neurology notes. - to control and test for
           cofounding conditions as well as risk stratify. To determine whether an individual is
           safe to enroll and receive study medications. To determine if an individual under
           therapy has become infected and guage severity of the infection. All imaging being
           performed is for standard of care and not study purposes.

        5. Date of symptom onset - to determine optimal timing of post-exposure prophylaxis during
           data analysis. To determine time to event.

        6. Date of resolution - to assess effects of medication treatment on duration and severity
           of disease.

        7. All medications that the patient is on or has been on within the proceeding 1 month - to
           assess for possible complications or medication interactions.

        8. Hospitiization records, particulary records with regards to ICU admission, ICU
           discharge, need for supplemental oxygen, length of stay, ICU length of stay, and/or need
           for mechanical ventilation - to properly assess severity, disease duration, and course
           for secondary outcome analysis.

        9. Date of treatment start - to assess for optimal timing of initiation of secondary
           prophylaxis or time to onset of symptoms after prophylaxis.

       10. Date of treatment termination - to assess for relapses or worsening timing after
           cessation of treatment.

             -  Witness:

      &quot;In order to conduct human research in this Commonwealth of Virginia, informed consent must
      be obtained if the person who is to be the human subject is as follows:(i) capable of making
      an informed decision, then it shall be subscribed to in writing by the person and witnessed;
      or (ii) incapable of making an informed decision at the time consent is required, then it
      shall be subscribed to in writing by the person and witnessed. Therefore the &quot;impartial
      witness&quot; section in the consent form will be used for all subjects consented in the
      Commonwealth of Virginia.

      Responsibilities of the impartial witness include the following:

        -  Read the informed consent and all written materials given to the subject

        -  Confirm the subject was presented sufficient information to assure that the subject was
           truly informed

        -  Sign and date the informed consent form after the informed consent and any other written
           information provided to the subject is read and explained.

      A signature from the impartial witness will serve as documentation of this process within the
      subject's study file. The subject will also need to sign and date or mark the informed
      consent showing appropriate consent for participation.&quot;
