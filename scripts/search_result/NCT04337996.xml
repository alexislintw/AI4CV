    <textblock>
      This work aims to compare 3 tests: PCR, an antigenic Rapid Diagnostic Orientation Test (RODT)
      and a serological TROD.

      PCR is a long test, the virology laboratory is overloaded, the cost is high, leading to a
      limitation in the number of screening tests performed and the need to expand and improve the
      range of screening tests available.

      This is an interventional study comparing 3 COVID-19 diagnostic tests performed at 3
      different periods: in ascending epidemic period, in descending epidemic period, in post
      epidemic period in order to compare the specificity and sensitivity of the tests available.
      Patients will be sampled for the 3 tests at Day 1 and Day 5 and then monitored for symptoms
      and clinical data at Day 21 and Day 28.
