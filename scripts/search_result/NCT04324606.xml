      A phase I/II single-blinded, randomised, placebo controlled, multi-centre study to determine
      efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the candidate Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) vaccine
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in UK healthy adult volunteers aged 18-55 years. The vaccine will be
      administered intramuscularly (IM).

      There will be 5 study groups and it is anticipated that a total of 510 volunteers will be
      enrolled. Volunteers will participate in the study for approximately 6 months, with the
      option to come for an additional follow up visit at Day 364.

             requirements.

          -  Willing to allow the investigators to discuss the volunteer's medical history with
             their General Practitioner and access all medical records when relevant to study
             procedures.

          -  For females only, willingness to practice continuous effective contraception (see
             below) during the study and a negative pregnancy test on the day(s) of screening and
             vaccination.

          -  Agreement to refrain from blood donation during the course of the study.

          -  Provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The volunteer may not enter the study if any of the following apply:

          -  Prior receipt of any vaccines (licensed or investigational) ≤30 days before enrolment

          -  Planned receipt of any vaccine other than the study intervention within 30 days before
             and after each study vaccination .

          -  Prior receipt of an investigational or licensed vaccine likely to impact on

             vaccines).

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the planned administration of the vaccine candidate.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient state, including HIV
             infection; asplenia; recurrent severe infections and chronic use (more than 14 days)
             immunosuppressant medication within the past 6 months (topical steroids are allowed).

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or MenACWY vaccines.

          -  Any history of hereditary angioedema or idiopathic angioedema.

          -  Any history of anaphylaxis in relation to vaccination.

          -  Pregnancy, lactation or willingness/intention to become pregnant during the study.

             prior history of significant bleeding or bruising following IM injections or
             venepuncture.

          -  Any other serious chronic illness requiring hospital specialist supervision.

          -  Chronic respiratory diseases, including mild asthma

          -  Chronic cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disease, liver disease, renal
             disease, endocrine disorder and neurological illness

          -  Seriously overweight (BMI≥40 Kg/m2)

          -  Suspected or known current alcohol abuse as defined by an alcohol intake of greater
             than 42 units every week.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormal finding on screening biochemistry, haematology
             blood tests or urinalysis.

          -  Any other significant disease, disorder or finding which may significantly increase
             the risk to the volunteer because of participation in the study, affect the ability of
             the volunteer to participate in the study or impair interpretation of the study data.

          -  History of laboratory confirmed COVID-19.

          -  New onset of fever or a cough or shortness of breath in the 60 days preceding
             screening and/or enrolment

          -  Travel history to China since January 2020
