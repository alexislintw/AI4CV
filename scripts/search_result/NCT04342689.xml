    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of resistant potato
      starch in reducing rates of hospitalization and improving time to clinical recovery in
      currently non-hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a substantial strain on the healthcare system, with at least
      14% of infected patients requiring hospitalization. Identifying ways to ameliorate the
      progression and severity of the COVID-19 infection and preventing hospitalization is
      critical.

      Patients suffering from COVID-19 have been shown to have a significant inflammatory response
      resembling that of cytokine release syndrome, and it is this inflammatory phase that is
      thought to drive fatality. IL-6 has been shown to be one of the most commonly elevated
      inflammatory markers in COVID-19 patients, and Tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, has been used
      to ameliorate this exaggerated inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients. However, this is
      used mainly in already hospitalized patients who show signs of increased inflammation, and
      more research is needed on interventions that slow the onset of inflammation and decrease
      subsequent hospitalization of infected individuals.

      Resistant potato starch (RPS) has been shown to decrease IL-6 in humans, partly through its
      ability to increase butyrate levels. Butyrate not only reduces IL-6 production and overall
      inflammation, but also has been shown to specifically decrease lung inflammation in animal
      models through cytokine suppression. Further, it may reduce ACE2 receptor expression, which
      is the main entry mechanism for COVID-19 into epithelial lung cells. Increased butyrate in
      the intestinal microbiome is also associated with less viral lower respiratory tract
      infections in allo- HCT recipients. Our preliminary data shows an increase in butyrate levels
      in participants' stool within one week of RPS therapy (20 grams twice daily) with no
      noticeable side effect.

      To this end, we have designed a multicenter randomized clinical trial to determine the
      efficacy of resistant potato starch in reducing the need for hospitalization for COVID-19
      positive patients. We will enroll 1300 non-hospitalized COVID-19 positive individuals who are
      being monitored in the outpatient setting. Patients will be randomized to either receive RPS
      therapy (2 tablespoons (~ 20 grams) of RPS twice daily) or a placebo (2 tablespoons of
      non-resistant, digestible starch twice daily) , each for 14 days. Our primary outcome is the
      rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 related complications. Secondary outcomes will look at
      time to recovery and symptom severity scores.

    <masking_description>The study team will resource individuals to pre-package both the intervention and placebo into packages labeled either A or B. The labeling key code will not be shared with any of the study members nor recipients until the end of the study and data analysis. Stratified permutated block randomization will be used to generate randomization lists for each study site to appropriately deliver the packages to each participant. Placebo and intervention will be identical in appearance and packaging.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rates of hospitalization for a COVID-19 related complication</measure>
    <time_frame>One month from the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subject hospitalized while presenting symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, myalgia, cough, or hypoxia with an admission diagnosis of hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumonia, or vial pneumonia on review of electronic health record (EHR). Death prior to hospitalization thought to be secondary to COVID-19 will also be defined as an event. All hospital admissions will be reviewed and adjudicated by a site PI.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to clinical recovery (TTCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>One month from the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Time to clinical recovery will be defined by a return to normal body temperature (97-99 degrees F) as reported by the patient, and resolution of major presenting symptoms (myalgia, cough, shortness of breath, and GI symptoms) maintained for 72 hours. Patients will be called every 2 days for the first 14 days of the study, and then once weekly for the following 14 days to assess symptoms via a pre-specified questionnaire. Patients will continue to be followed for an additional 3 months via EHR review.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>One month from the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This score will be evaluated used in a subjective self-reporting questionnaire around 8 symptoms, which include: shortness of breath at rest or exertion, fatigue, myalgia/muscle aces, fever, cough, headache, GI symptoms, inability to taste or smell. Subjects will rate each of their symptoms on an ordinal scale as follows: absent (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). These symptom ratings will be added to define the symptom severity score with a possible score range of 0-24 points. Subjects will be called every 2 days for the first 14 days of the study, and then once weekly for the following 14 days to assess symptoms via this pre-specified questionnaire. Patients will continue to be followed for an additional 3 months via EHR review.</description>
