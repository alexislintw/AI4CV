  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized open label trial to compare effectiveness of two dosing regimens
      currently used for prevention of clotting events in COVID-19 positive inpatients. Both doses
      and routes of anticoagulation regimens are currently used in COVID-19 positive inpatients at
      NYU Langone Health.

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed study is designed as an open label randomized trial of patients hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients with a D-dimer &gt;500 ng/ml. Patients will be randomized to higher-dose anticoagulation versus lower-dose (e.g. prophylactic-dose) anticoagulation in 1:1 ratio.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the
        following criteria:

                  equipoise by the NYU medical community

               2. If a D-Dimer is &gt;2,000 and &lt; 10,000 and is not on a higher dose anticoagulation
                  and a blood clot is not suspected and there is clinical equipoise, a patient may
                  be approached for enrollment

        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation
        in this study:

          1. Meeting alternative indication for higher-dose anticoagulation

               1. Prevalent blood clot at the time of enrollment

               2. On renal replacement therapies (CRRT, CVVH)

               3. D-dimer &gt;10,000 ng/ml

               4. Change in D-dimer &gt;6X over the admission lab value

               5. Renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy

               6. Prior VTE

               7. Atrial fibrillation (with a CHADS2 Score &gt;1) on oral anticoagulant therapy
                  already

          2. Prior Heparin induced thrombocytopenia within 100 days

          3. Stroke within 30 days

          4. Prior hemorrhagic stroke (ever)

          5. GI bleed within the past 6 months

          6. Platelet count &lt;100,000

          7. Pregnancy

          8. Anemia with a hemoglobin &lt;9mg/dl

          9. Signs of active bleeding (e.g. requirement of a blood transfusion in the past 30 days)

         10. Other high bleeding risk (I.e. trauma, use of dual antiplatelet therapy)

         11. Renal failure on admission (by RIFLE criteria 3X change in serum creatinine from
             baseline or &gt;75% reduction in GFR or urine output &lt;0.3ml/kg over 24 hours or anuria
             for 12 hours)

         12. Subjects who have no capacity to consent for themselves.
