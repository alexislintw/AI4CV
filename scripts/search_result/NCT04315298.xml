      Phase 2:

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of sarilumab relative
      to the control arm in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 regardless of severity
      strata.

      Phase 3:

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of sarilumab relative
      to the control arm in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (severe and critical).

             neutrophil count (ANC) less than 2000 mm3, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), platelets &lt;50,000
             per mm3

          -  Treatment with anti-IL 6, anti-IL-6R antagonists, or with Janus kinase inhibitors

          -  Current treatment with the simultaneous combination of leflunomide and methotrexate

          -  Known active tuberculosis (TB), history of incompletely treated TB, suspected or known
             extrapulmonary TB, suspected or known systemic bacterial or fungal infections

          -  Patients who have received immunosuppressive antibody therapy within the past 5
             months, including intravenous immunoglobulin or plans to receive during the study
             period

          -  Participation in a double-blind clinical research study evaluating an investigational
             product (IP) or therapy within 3 months and less than 5 half-lives of IP prior to the
             screening visit (The use of remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, or other treatments being
             used for COVID-19 treatments in the context of an open-label study or compassionate
             use protocol is permitted)

          -  Any physical examination findings, and/or history of any illness, concomitant
             medications or recent live vaccines that, in the opinion of the study investigator,
             might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk to the patient by
             their participation in the study

          -  Known systemic hypersensitivity to sarilumab or the excipients of the drug product
