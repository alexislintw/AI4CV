      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of tocilizumab combined with pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) compared to standard care in adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and bad
      prognostic factors who are nonresponsive to frontline therapy within 48 hours from treatment

         10. Bowel diverticulitis or perforation.

         11. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency receiving immunosuppressive therapy within seven days
             prior to study treatment initiation. Active autoimmune disease that has required

             corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs).

         12. Current known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus
             (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients with past HBV infection or resolved HBV

             positive hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] test, accompanied by a negative HBV DNA
             test) are eligible. Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase
             chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA).

             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live-attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

         14. History of prior allogeneic bone marrow, stem-cell, or solid organ transplantation.

         15. Patients have any other concurrent severe medical condition that would, in the
