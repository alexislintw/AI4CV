      Background:

      - Viral infections are an important cause of illness and death in hospitalized patients as
      well as outpatients. New strains of viruses may appear and infect both healthy people and
      those with weak immune systems. A better understanding of these new virus strains may help to
      control and prevent these infections. In particular, some viral infections that are less
      problematic in healthy persons can be life threatening in persons with weak immune systems,
      and viruses may be able to evolve more rapidly in persons with weak immune systems and
      therefore develop resistance to existing treatments. Researchers are interested in collecting
      samples and information from otherwise healthy persons or persons with weak immune systems to
      study the effects of viruses and their development.

      Objectives:

      - To collect samples and data from individuals who have been exposed to or have contracted
      viral infections.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals of all ages who have been diagnosed with a viral infection are suspected to
           have a viral infection, or have been in close contact with someone with a suspected or
           actual viral infection that is of interest to investigators in the Laboratory of
           Infectious Diseases.

        -  Healthy persons and persons with weak immune systems (immunocompromised individuals) are
           eligible to participate.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be initially screened with a review of the medical records and if
           eligible a history and physical will be performed.

        -  Study procedures may include blood, stool, urine, saliva, or nasal fluid samples, and
           throat and genital swabs. For participants who have a specialized sample collection
           procedure as part of their medical care (e.g., spinal tap, bronchoscopy, liver biopsy),
           researchers may collect leftover samples from the clinical laboratory for testing.

        -  Samples may be collected up to four times per week during the first 2 weeks after
           enrollment in the study, and then as many as two times per week for up to 1 year. The
           number of study visits will be determined by the study researchers, and will depend on
           the virus being studied. Some participants may be asked to continue providing samples
           for longer than 1 year if there is concern for recurrence or relapse of the infection or
           if the study researchers feel that there are other reasons where it would be important
           to follow the viral infection.

        -  For otherwise healthy persons who have been exposed to a viral infection, an initial
           specimen will be collected and then up to three additional specimens may be collected
           over 1 year.

        -  Treatment will not be offered under this study.

      Viral infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients
      as well as out-patients. New strains of viruses may appear and cause epidemics in healthy
      persons or immunocompromised persons. A better understanding of these new virus strains may
      help to control and prevent these infections. Some viral infections that would otherwise be
      asymptomatic or cause mild disease can be life threatening in immunocompromised persons.
      Immunocompromised persons often shed high titers of virus for prolonged periods of time. In
      the absence of a potent immune system, viruses may evolve more rapidly in their hosts.
      Therefore, analysis of sequential virus specimens from these patients can provide information
      on virus evolution, including how resistance to antiviral agents can develop. In addition,
      higher titers of virus may be associated with virus mutants that are more adapted to grow in
      cell culture. In this protocol we will obtain specimens containing viruses from otherwise
      healthy or immunocompromised patients over sequential periods of time to study their nucleic
      acid sequences, sensitivity to antiviral agents, cell types infected by the virus, and
      ability to grow in cell culture. In some cases we weill review tissue biosies or clinical
      reports from outside laboratories to assist with the diagnosis of virus-associated diseases.
      We will also record the patient s signs and symptoms, note results of any pertinent
      laboratory work-up, and in some cases, obtain blood to measure immune responses, isolate
      antibodies, or to look for viremia. This study should provide further understanding on how
      viruses evolve in their natural hosts, how they become resistant to antiviral agents, how
      antibody responses evolve to viruses, and might allow some currently uncultivatable viruses
      to be grown in cell culture.

        Healthy or immunocompromised subjects with viral infections, or suspected of having a viral
        infection, or recovering from a viral infection, or a close contact of someone who has had
        or is suspected to have had an acute or chronic viral infection. Subjects may either be at
        the Clinical Center or samples may be sent to LID directly from subjects enrolled at
        non-NIH sites.
