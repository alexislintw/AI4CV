      Brief Summary:

      SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is known to cause Lung Injury that begins as dyspnea and exercise
      intolerance, but may rapidly progress to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and the need for
      mechanical ventilation. Mortality rates as high as 80% have been reported among those who
      develop ARDS, despite intensive care and mechanical ventilation.

      Patients with COVID-19 induced non-Acute Lung Injury who have demonstrated reduction in blood
      oxygenation, dyspnea, and exercise intolerance but do not require endotracheal intubation and
      mechanical ventilation will be treated with Aviptadil, a synthetic version of Vasoactive
      Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) plus Standard of Care vs. placebo + Standard of Care. Patients
      will be randomized to intravenous Aviptadil will receive inhaled Aviptadil, 100 μg 3x daily
      vs. placebo 3x daily. The primary outcome will be progression to ARDS over 28 days. Secondary
      outcomes will include blood oxygenation as measured by pulse oximetry, dyspnea, exercise
      tolerance, and levels of TNFα IL-6 and other cytokines.

      Detailed Description:

      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a known lethal complication of Corona Virus
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Conventional medical therapy, including intensive care and
      respiratory support is associated with an 80% mortality.

      The objective of this study is to identify patients with non-Acute Lung Injury (NALI) in
      COVID-19 and treat them with inhaled Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) in the hope of
      preventing progression from NALI to Acute Lung Injury and ARDS. Aviptadil, a synthetic form
      of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for
      the treatment of ARDS.

      Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung, where it
      prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits IL6 and TNFa production,
      protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, These and other effects have been observed in
      numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and
      dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar
      interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure.

      Aviptadil is approved for human use in Europe and has a demonstrated 20 year history of
      safety in numerous trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, Erectile
      Dysfunction, and a phase I trial in ARDS. In that phase I trial, 8 patients with severe ARDS
      on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP. Seven of the 8 patients
      were successfully extubated and were alive at the five day timepoint. Six left the hospital
      and one died of an unrelated cardiac event.

      Five phase 2 trials of aviptadil have been conducted under European regulatory authority.
      Numerous healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well
      tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or
      ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded
      basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores
      function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI).

      In this study, patients who are hospitalized for COVID-19 infection with NALI but no evidence
      of ARDS will be randomly allocated to Aviptadil administered by inhalation in addition to
      Standard of Care vs. Placebo plus Standard of Care. Primary endpoints will be progression to
      ARDS over 28 days and improvement in blood oxygenation. Secondary outcomes will include blood
      oxygenation as measured by pulse oximetry, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and levels of TNFα
      IL-6 and other cytokines.
