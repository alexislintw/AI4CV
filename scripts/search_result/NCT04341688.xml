  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pakistan is a resource restraint country, it's not possible to carry out coronavirus testing
      at mass scale. Simple cost effective intervention against the present pandemic is highly
      desirable.

      For patients: Identifying an antiviral gargle that could substantially reduce the colonies of
      COVID-19 residing in mouth and oro-naso-pharynx is likely to reduce the viral load. Such
      reduction in the viral load through surface debridement could aid the effective immune
      response in improving the overall symptoms of the patients.

      For dentists: This study is important because the nature of the dental profession involves
      aerosol production, carrying out dental work on asymptomatic patients carrying coronavirus
      puts the entire dental team at a great risk of not only acquiring the infection but also
      transmitting it to the others. Antiviral gargles could be used by dentist and their
      auxiliaries as prophylaxis.

      For physicians and nurses: The risk of morbidity and mortality is high among physicians and
      nurses involved in the screening and management of Covid-19 patients. Globally, over 215
      physicians and surgeons have died while taking care of Covid-19 patients. The cause of death
      is attributed to high exposure of viral load. The antiviral gargles and nasal lavage can
      decrease the fatalities among doctors and nurses.

      Thus, patients, physicians, nurses and dentists, all could be benefited with this findings of
      this study.

      It will be a parallel group, quadruple blind-randomized controlled trial annexed with a
      laboratory based study. Clinical trial will be carried out at the Aga Khan University
      Hospital (AKUH), Karachi, Pakistan. Patients will be inducted from the pool of known patients
      (laboratory confirmed COVID-19 participants) already admitted at AKUH. Molecular and
      immunological testing will be done at the Juma laboratory of AKUH. The intervention drugs
      (Povidone-Iodine, Hydrogen Peroxide and Hypertonic Saline will be obtained from the AKUH
      distribution department and/ or AKUH pharmacy. The Neem extract will be compounded at the
      Chemistry department, University of Karachi/ HEJ institute of Organic Chemistry, University
      of Karachi.

      We will need 50 patients. There will be six study groups. Group A (n=10) patients on 10 ml
      gargle and nasal lavage with of 0.2% Povidone-Iodine for 20-30 seconds, twice daily for 5
      days. Group B (n=10) patients will be subjected to 10 ml gargle and nasal lavage with 1%
      Hydrogen peroxide for 20-30 seconds, twice daily for 5 days. Group C will comprise of (n=10)
      subjects using 10ml gargle and nasal lavage with Neem extract (Azardirachta indica) for 20-30
      seconds, twice daily for 5 days. Group D (n=10) patients will use 2% hypertonic saline gargle
      and nasal lavage for a similar time period. Group E (n=5) will serve as positive controls.
      These will be given simple distilled water gargles and nasal lavage for 20-30 seconds, thrice
      daily for six days whereas the Group F (n=5) will be comprised of negative controls, who will
      not use any gargles or nasal lavage during study period. For nasal lavage, a special douche
      syringe will be provided to each participant. Its use will be thoroughly explained by the
      data collection officer.

      Data collection: The baseline oral swab will be taken from the posterior pharyngeal wall on
      day one before initiating the gargles by trained dentist. The end-point oral swab will be
      taken on day 5, just after using the prescribed gargle. Patient will be provided with a
      special hood so that they themselves don't generate aerosol in the immediate vicinity while
      carrying out the gargling and nasal lavage.

      Data will be analyzed using SPSS for Windows (version 20.0 SPSS) and Graph Pad (Prism)
      softwares. Mean and standard deviation of the continuous variables (age, COVID-19 viral
      counts at baseline and endpoint etc.) will be computed. Frequency distribution of the
      categorical variables will be determined (gender, co-morbids, presence of hypertension,
      diabetes, periodontal status etc.) Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to compare the
      reduction in intra-oral viral loads and the change in inflammatory biomarkers in the four
      study groups. Mutiple linear regression will be applied on the change in viral load and
      Inflammatory cytokines. A subset analysis using Zero inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model
      will be employed if there is a significant reduction in viral load is observed in any of the
      study groups. A p-value of &lt;0.05 will be taken as statistically significant.
