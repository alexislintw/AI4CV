    <textblock>
      This Phase IIB study will evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin
      (Azithro) to prevent hospitalization or death in symptomatic adult outpatients with COVID-19.

      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive active/placebo study treatment as follows:
      HCQ/Placebo 600 mg immediately followed by 200 mg three times a day for 7 days and
      Azithro/Placebo 500 mg on the first day, followed by 250 mg daily for 4 days.

      Stratification will be by &quot;high&quot; versus &quot;low&quot; risk of progression to severe COVID-19 disease,
      where &quot;high risk&quot; is defined as a person age ≥60 years or having at least one of several
      specified comorbidities.

      Participants will receive study treatment for 7 days and will be followed for an additional
      23 weeks. Assessments on a subset of 200 participants will include blood collection,
      self-collected nasal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs.
