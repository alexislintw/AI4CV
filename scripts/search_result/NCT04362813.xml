  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the
      efficacy and safety of canakinumab plus standard-of-care (SOC) compared with placebo plus SOC
      in adult patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      assess the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia and
      cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The study will enroll patients to canakinumab or placebo, in
      addition to standard of care (SOC) per local practice, which may include anti-viral
      treatment, corticosteroids and/or supportive care.

      Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      either canakinumab + SOC or placebo + SOC and can be dosed immediately after ensuring that
      the patient has met all eligibility criteria. Patients in the canakinumab arm will be dosed
      on Day 1 with canakinumab 450 mg for body weight of 40-&lt;60 kg, 600 mg for 60-80 kg or 750 mg
      for &gt;80 kg in 250 mL of 5% dextrose infused IV over 2 hours. Patients in the placebo arm will
      be administered with 250 mL of 5% dextrose infused IV over 2 hours.

      The study will include:

        -  Screening period of 0-1 day

        -  Study period from initial dose on Day 1 to Day 29 or hospital discharge

        -  Follow-up to Day 127 The primary objective is to demonstrate the benefit of canakinumab
           + SOC in increasing the chance of survival without ever requiring invasive mechanical
           ventilation among patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia and CRS.

    <description>Clinical response is defined as survival without ever requiring invasive mechanical ventilation from Day 3 to Day 29 (both inclusive). A patient will be defined as a non-responder if the worst clinical status at any time from Day 3 to Day 29 is score 6, 7 or 8 on a 9-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 up to 8.
Scores 6, 7 and 8 in the 9-point ordinal scale are defined as follows: Hospitalized patients with severe disease have score 6 if they need intubation and mechanical ventilation and score 7 if they need ventilation + additional organ support (pressors, renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Patients who die have score 8.</description>
