    <textblock>
      Protocol bacTRL-Spike-1 will be the first-in-human study of bacTRL-Spike, and the
      first-in-human use of orally delivered bacTRL. Each oral dose of bacTRL-Spike contains
      bacterial medium with either 1 billion (Group 1A), 3 billion (Group 2A) or 10 billion (Group
      3A) colony-forming-units of live Bifidobacterium longum, which has been engineered to deliver
      plasmids containing synthetic DNA encoding spike protein from SARS-CoV-2. Placebo will
      consist of bacterial medium without bacteria.

      Protocol bacTRL-Spike-1 will be the first-in-human study of bacTRL-Spike, and the
      first-in-human use of orally delivered bacTRL. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of orally delivered bacTRL-Spike vaccine in healthy adults.

      Total anticipated enrollment is n=84, including 63 receiving active vaccine in bacterial
      medium and 21 receiving placebo (bacterial medium only). The distribution of the sample size
      will be as follows:

        -  Group 1A (n=21): Single dose of bacTRL-Spike, equivalent to 1 billion colony forming
           units (cfu) of Bifidiobacterium longum;

        -  Group 1B (n=7): Single dose of placebo;

        -  Group 2A (n=21): Single dose of bacTRL-Spike, equivalent to 3 billion cfu of B. longum;

        -  Group 2B (n=7): Single dose of placebo;

        -  Group 3A (n=21): Single dose of bacTRL-Spike, equivalent to 10 billion cfu of B. longum;

        -  Group 3B (n=7): Single dose of placebo. The planned trial duration is 18 months.

      Each participant will remain in the trial for 12-13 months, including a screening phase of up
      to 14 days, intervention phase of 1 day and follow-up phase of 12 months.
