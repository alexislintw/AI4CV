  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy of the 'test and treat' strategy of infected
      patients and prophylactic chloroquine treatment to all contacts. The strategy entails
      decentralized COVID-19 testing and starting chloroquine treatment immediately in all who are
      found to be infected. As viral loads decline to undetectable levels, the probability of
      onward transmission is reduced to very low levels. Such evaluation will require prospective
      surveillance to assess the population-level effect of transmission prevention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research on influenza has indicated that antiviral drugs administered before o short
      after symptom onset can reduce infectiousness to others by reducing viral loads in the
      respiratory secretions of patients.

      Lopinavir/ritonavir, a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV/AIDS, was found to block COVID-19
      infection in vitro at low-micromolar concentration, with a half-maximal effective
      concentration (EC50) of 8.5 μM. China's guidelines were set up in January 2020 and treated
      hospitalized patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, either alone or with various combinations.
      Darunavir (DRV)/Cobicistat, is also a protease inhibitor used to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS.
      Its as effective as lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and better tolerated
      because the adverse effects rate is lower (diarrhea 2% vs 27%).

      In last week DRV has been shown to exert no activity on the SARS-CoV-2 clinical studies and
      is therefore withdrawn for futility. Although LPVr shows in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2
      at elevated total drug concentrations, human clinical trials have not demonstrated
      superiority of LPVr vs Placebo. It has been considered that the magnitude of the possible
      clinical benefit of LPVr if it is started in the early stages of the disease is small and
      does not compensate for the gastrointestinal and renal toxicity of the drug.

      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug that has been extensively used for the prevention of
      malaria. HCQ showed excellent in vitro results and strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2
      infection of primate cells at low concentration.
