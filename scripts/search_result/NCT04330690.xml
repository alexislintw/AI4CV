      This study is an adaptive, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either standard-of-care products or the study
      medication plus standard of care, while being hospitalized for COVID-19.

      Lopinavir/ritonavir will be administered 400 mg/100 mg orally (or weight based dose
      adjustment for children) for a 14-day course, or until discharge from hospital, whichever
      occurs first

      This study is an adaptive, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either standard-of-care products (control) or the
      study medication plus standard of care while being hospitalized for lab confirmed COVID-19.
      Randomization will be stratified by i) site; and ii) severity of illness (see section 5);
      iii) age &lt; 55

      Lopinavir/ritonavir will be administered orally for a 14-day course, or until discharge from
      hospital; subjects who can swallow will be given 2 tablets (200 mg/50mg) twice daily; for
      those who cannot swallow, 5 mL oral suspension (400 mg.100 mg/5 mL) will be given twice
      daily. Children will receive 10 mg/kg of lopinavir/ritonavir, via tablet or suspension, twice
      daily, capped at the maximum adult dose.

      Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized, including Oropharyngeal (OP) swabbing on
      days 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, and 29. Discharged subjects will be telephoned at Days 15, 29, and
      60. Hospitalized subjects will require blood sampling on days 1, 5 and 11

Lopinavir/ritonavir will be the first agent tested. Additional arms will be added as data emerges.
This study is intended to allow for multiple adaptations, including: i) the primary endpoint at the first interim analysis, based on performance characteristics, both in its characteristics and its timepoint, with adapted sample size calculations performed for the new primary endpoints; ii) Intervention arm, with emerging data from both internal and external to the trial, with arms being dropped or added based on pre-specified stopping rules in conjunction with the DSMB.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>As per World Health Organization policies on data sharing in a Public Health Emergency, any clinical trial outcome data will be shared at the earliest possible opportunity. In addition, given the nature of this protocol, being performed across regions, the DSMB may access other regions trials, and possibly recommend alterations in study design based on accumulating data, through a centralized data repository being built under the auspices of the World Health Organization.
Data Sharing for Secondary Research Data from this study may be used for secondary research. All of the individual subject data collected during the trial will be made available after de-identification through expert determination. The SAP and Analytic Code will also be made available. This data will be available immediately following publication, with no end date, as part of data sharing requirements from journals and funding agencies.</ipd_description>
