  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon admission to the hospital, patients with documented COVID-19 infection will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive Piclidenoson 2 mg Q12H orally with standard care (intervention arm)
      or standard care alone (control arm). Piclidenoson will be administered on an empty stomach,
      i.e, 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. Patients' vital signs (temperature, blood
      pressure, pulse rate per minute, breath rate per minute and oxygen saturation), will be
      monitored according to standard of care (SoC). Symptom questionnaires will be collected from
      patients once daily during the period of hospitalization. Efficacy of Piclidenoson will be
      assessed by analysis of COVID-19 (Fluxergy, Irvine CA), in respiratory secretions obtained by
      nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, collected consecutively at day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21
      and 28 following initial diagnosis, in addition to its effect on different clinical outcomes.
      Safety and tolerability of Piclidenoson will be assessed by AE monitoring, vital signs and
      ECG assessment and clinical laboratory tests (CBC, and extended chemistry panel).
