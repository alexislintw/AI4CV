           Brief Summary:

           On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in
           Wuhan, China. On 9 January 2020, China CDC reported a novel coronavirus as the causative
           agent of this outbreak, which is phylogenetically in the SARS-CoV clade. The disease
           associated with the virus is referred to as novel coronavirus disease
           (COVID-19).Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe
           acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 and for which there are currently
           no approved treatments. Here, the principal investigator reports according to previous
           studies and research findings that retinoic acid could strongly affect both inflammation
           and viral entry in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and severe acute
           respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection via modulating and reducing
           cytokine storm factors (IL- 6,IL-1,IL-10 and tumor necrosis factors alpha ) which are
           over expressed in COVID 2019 infection and contribute to disease progression, poor
           outcomes and poor survival in patients infected with severe acute respiratory
           syndrome(SARS-CoV-2) and also, via blocking viral entry by inhibition factor which
           induce Serine protease 2 expression rather than inhibition of ACE2 ,AT1 protein and Ang
           II-mediated intracellular calcium release pathway which is responsible for SARS-CoV-2
           cell fusion and entry as opposed to medications that upregulate ACE-2 receptors might
           increase the risk of infection and subsequent complications.Retinoic acid which induce
           FOXP3 and CD8+,CD4+,CD25+,FOXP3+ Tregs which their absence during acute infection alters
           the ability of the host to limit tissue damage. and T cells which were dramatically
           reduced in COVID-19 patients to exert its antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect
           protecting lung cells and neural cells from the inflammatory and the destructive effect
           of IL-6. In addition to inducing retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1) and endosomal
           toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. This recognition
           resulted in the formation of type-1 interferon (IFN1). As an evasion mechanism, virus
           synthesize proteins that hinder the production of IFN type1 in COVID 2019 . In adition
           to its anti-platelet and fibrinolytic activities protecting patients infected with covid
           2019 infection from widespread blood clots.

           Keywords: COVID 2019 , Retinoic acid, Endosomal toll-like receptor 3,T Cells, IFN type1,

      Since an effective immune response against viral infections depends on the activation of
      cytotoxic T cells that can clear infection by killing virus-infected cells , boosting the
      numbers and function of T cells in COVID-19 patients is critical for successful recovery. A
      recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID-19 cases displayed low circulating lymphocyte
      counts. A CoV infects macrophages, and then macrophages present CoV antigens to T cells. This
      process leads to T cell activation and differentiation, including the production of cytokines
      associated with the different T cell subsets (Th17), followed by a massive release of
      cytokines for immune response amplification. The continued production of these mediators due
      to viral persistence has a negative effect on NK, and CD8 T cell activation. However, CD8 T
      cells produce very effective mediators to clear CoV However, the factors which might cause
      the reduction in count, and the activation status of T cells in COVID-19 patients, remain
      uninvestigated.

      Recent study of 522 COVID patients and 40 healthy controls from two hospitals in Wuhan, China
      demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α
      concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α
      concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly
      higher levels of the exhausted marker programmed cell death protein(PD-1) as compared to
      health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as
      patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T
      cell exhaustion. T cell exhaustion is a progressive loss of effector function due to
      prolonged antigen stimulation, characteristic of chronic infections. Dendritic cell
      inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during chronic
      hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear nCoV2019.

      Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in innate immune and adaptive immune responses. As the
      strongest antigen presenting cells in the organism, they effectively stimulate the activation
      of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, thus combining innate and adaptive immunity. Immature DCs
      have strong migration ability, and mature DCs can effectively activate T cells in the central
      link of startup, regulation, and maintenance of immune responses. Thus, once the maturation
      process of DCs is blocked, it directly affects the initiation of subsequent adaptive immune
      response. MERS-CoV-2 is able to affect human dendritic cells and macrophages in-vitro
      .Productive replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in monocyte-derived
      dendritic cells modulates innate immune response.

      Another study proposed that C -C chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4) contributes to T cell lung
      homing imprinting. It was found that lung DCs induce the expression of CCR4 on T cells. Lung
      DCs-activated T cells traffic more efficiently into the lung and protect against influenza
      more effectively compared with T cells activated by DCs from other tissues. Lim and
      colleagues suggested that CXCR4 plays a role in CD8+ T cell migration to airway tissues

      Dendritic cell inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during
      chronic hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear
      nCoV2019

      Presence of RA in different tissues is very imprtant for immune induction and fighting viral
      infection, for example, RA is present at high concentrations in the small intestine due to
      metabolizing dietary vitamin A by gut epithelial cells. In this local environment, RA
      activate and primes dendritic cells (DCs) to become CD103+ DCs that produce RA.3, 4CD103+ DCs
      are migratory cells that activate naive T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes to become effector
      T cells that contribute to both intestinal homeostasis and immunity.and also RA is an
      important signal that induces IgA-producing B cells. The gut homing T cells and B cells play
      essential roles in protecting the digestive tract from pathogens.

      Retinoic acid (atRA) can inhibit the spontaneous apoptosis of activated human T lymphocytes
      in vitro. 13-cis RA activates Th2 cytokine production Enhanced circulating dendritic cell
      numbers.

      So, according to this previous studies the principal investigator suggests that T cells
      lymphopenia and exhaustion may be resulted by Dendritic cells (DCs) infection and inhibition
      by MERS-CoV-2.

      Retinoic acid has profound effects on cellular proliferation and differentiation. Moreover,
      it has been reported that ATRA exhibits both anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects.
      Recent studies have shown that FOXP3 expression and the immune function of Regulatory T cells
      (Tregs ) can be enhanced by ATRA in the immune system of both patients and mic.13Retinoic
      acid (RA) is produced by a number of cell types, including macrophages and dendritic cells,
      which express retinal dehydrogenases that convert vitamin A to its main biologically active
      metabolite, all-trans RA. All-trans RA binds to its nuclear retinoic acid receptors that are
      expressed in lymphoid cells and act as transcription factors to regulate cell homing and
      differentiation. RA production by CD103+ dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages functions
      with TGF-b to promote conversion of naive T cells into Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and,
      thereby, maintain mucosal tolerance

      So, principal investigator expects high inducing of Dendritic cells (DCs) by retinoic acid
      treatment which will lead to T cells activation and migration with less exhaustion
      phenomenon.

      According to this protocol treatment with retinoic acid will induce FOXP3 and
      CD8+,CD4+,CD25+,FOXP3+ Tregs which their absence during acute infection alters the ability of
      the host to limit tissue damage and inducesT cells which were dramatically reduced in
      COVID-19 patients to exert its antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect protecting lung cells
      and neural cells from the inflammatory and the destructive effect of IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-α
      which are induced and highly expressed in COVID 2019 patients.

      Researchers from Wenzhou, China looked at clinical laboratory features including lipid levels
      of patients with COVID 19. They found dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels of
      patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls .The study provides data to
      suggest that cholesterol levels decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection
      and increase as the patient starts to recover. Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may
      have an important role to play in defending the body against such infections According to our
      protocol depending on previous studies the principal investigator demonstrated that there is
      a strong relation between immune system and cholesterol levels .When the cholesterol level is
      low specifically in the case of viral infection like COVID 2019 infection the immune system
      is impaired and the antiviral immune cells will be declined and inhibited :-

      Cellular cholesterol is a component of the plasma membrane and is also essential in cell
      proliferation. Regulation of intracellular cholesterol levels has been proposed as a
      mechanism to regulate T cell and macrophages proliferation. Intracellular cholesterol level
      is regulated by two competing pathways, cholesterol uptake and efflux, and ABCA1 plays a
      major role in the cholesterol efflux pathway. The ATRA induces ABCA1 expression and
      ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux in activated primary human CD4+ T cells implying that RA
      could affect T cell functions by regulating the cellular cholesterol levels.

      ATRA upregulates ABCA1 expression only in activated CD4+ T cells, indicating that induction
      of ABCA1 by ATRA and 13 cis Retinoic Acid may play an important role in immune response.

      Retinoic acid and liver X receptor agonist synergistically inhibit HIV infection in CD4+ T
      cells by up-regulating ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux.

      So, the principal investigator expects that retinoic acid treatment will highly induce T
      cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells, T helper via cholesterol efflux and inducing
      ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) and protect lung and neural cells and inhibit COVID
      2019 infection.

      The genome of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus is recognized by melanoma
      differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA5), retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1) and
      endosomal toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. This
      recognition resulted in the formation of type-1 interferon (IFN1). As an evasion mechanism,
      virus synthesize proteins that hinder the production IFN1 in the pathway.

      RA also acts directly on macrophages at both mucosal sites and other immunological sites.
      AtRA modulates peritoneal macrophage activation by endotoxin and IFN-γ by suppressing TNF
      production and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis .In addition, at RA inhibits the expression of
      PGE2 and COX-2 and the release of TNF, which are induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS) in murine peritoneal macrophages .

      A study reported recently that substance (ATRA) have preventive effects on pulmonary fibrosis
      by inhibiting IL-6-dependent proliferation and TGF-β1-dependent trans differentiation of lung
      fibroblasts. Also, another studies demonstrated that 13-cis-retinoic acid and other retinoid
      analogs inhibit IL-1-induced IL-6 production and that this effect is analog-specific and, at
      least partially, transcriptionally mediated. This effect was dose-dependent with an IC50 of
      10(-7) M RA and significant inhibition being noted with doses of RA as low as 10(-8) M. IL-10
      production was inhibited by ATRA administration.

      A study demonstrated that TLR3(-/-), TLR4(-/-), and TRAM(-/-) mice are more susceptible to
      SARS-CoV than wild-type mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in
      response to infection. In contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF are highly
      susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, showing increased weight loss, mortality, reduced lung
      function, increased lung pathology, and higher viral titers . New studies showed that the
      high level of IFN-α/β produced from the TLR3-IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN-β is the reason for
      inhibiting DENV replication. 13Cis retinoic Acid induced significant upregulation of
      toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) resulting in an immune response to dsRNA intermediate which can
      be partially generated during CoV-2 replicationTLR3 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of
      signaling pathways (IRFs and NFκB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I
      IFNs. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins
      for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory proteins of CoV can interfere
      with TLR3 signaling and bind the dsRNA of CoV during replication to prevent TLR3 activation
      and evade the immune response. 13Cis retinoic Acid induced significant upregulation of
      toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) , mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and
      retinoid-induced gene I (RIG-I) and IFN regulatory factor 1 expression in a time-dependent.

      In further research, Tsai .and Chen showed the high level of IFN-α/β produced from the
      TLR3-IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN-β is the reason for inhibiting DENV replication. In HUH-7
      cells, huTLR3 can recognize DENV-1 and induce the expression of IFN-β, which can enhance the
      expression of huTLR3 on the contrary . TLR3 also induces type I IFN during WNV.

      Doctors treating the sickest Covid-19 patients have zeroed in on a new phenomenon: Some
      people have developed widespread blood clots, their lungs peppered with tiny blockages that
      prevent oxygen from pumping into the bloodstream and body.As with so much else about the
      Covid-19 response, health experts are learning about the symptom on the fly. Blood clots are
      common in patients who are immobilized, but they seem to be smaller and cause far more severe
      damage in some Covid-19 patients. Doctors have said they see patients with blood clots
      forming not only in their lungs, but also in blood vessels. Autopsies have also revealed
      blood clots in kidneys and other organs, which some experts say suggests an overwhelming
      immune system response to the virus that inflicts harm on the body

      Retinoic acid, is known to possess in vivo anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet and fibrinolytic
      activities. A study investigated the in vitro thrombin and platelet aggregation inhibitory
      activities of retinoic acid and retinaldehyde.Retinoic acid, retinaldehyde and retinol
      exhibited potent inhibition of thrombin, with IC50 values of 67μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 152μg/ml,
      respectively for the inhibition of thrombin (Sigma); and 49μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 178μg/ml,
      respectively for the inhibition of thrombin (plasma). Amongst vitamin A and its derivatives,
      retinoic acid showed the highest inhibition of both the forms of thrombin.

      Retinoic acid(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 entry via down regulation of ACE2 ,
      AT1 protein and Ang II-mediated intracellular calcium release rather than inhibition of
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) and this is discussed as follow :

      Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
      SARS-CoV FP FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity
      via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D)
      residuesdemonstrated that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by
      approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+interaction. Electron spin
      resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP
      fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that
      MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds to two Ca2+ ion.

      Angiotensin II increases the intracellular calcium activity in podocytes of the intact
      glomerulus. The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine did not influence the Ang II-mediated
      [Ca2+] increase and it has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate
      residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II
      activity leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage,
      which increases the risk for acute lung injury (ALI). AngII via AT1 receptors upregulates
      many proinflammatory genes, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular
      adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6).30 but 13cis RA specifically
      down-regulated the AT1 protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Down-regulation of the
      AT1 expression leads to reduced AngII-mediated intracellular calcium release Similarly with
      receptor down-regulation, Treatment with 13cRA resulted in a significant reduction in AT1
      mRNA .13cRA has a glucose- and RAR/RXR independent mechanism for transcriptional inhibition
      of AT1, And also isotretinoin (13cRA) is the strongest down-regulator of ACE2. ACE2 which is
      the receptor of COVID 2019, Since SARS -CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses
      have revealed key atomic -level interactions between SARS - CoV spike protein receptor
      -binding domain key atomic -level interactions between SARS - CoV spike protein receptor
      -binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which
      regulate both the cross -species and human -to -human transmissions of SARS - CoV and starts
      endocytosis process (epithelial cell entry and invasion). As Principal Investigator discussed
      before that (13cRA) is the strongest down-regulator of ACE2. and the principal investigator
      expects that 13cRA can inhibit or dowenrgulat ACE2 by direc interaction and binding with the
      transmembrane ACE2, Suggesting its therapeutic potential in preventing the entry of COVID
      2019 to the host cell.

      TMPRSS2 is both the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer and a critical
      factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The modulation of
      its expression by steroids could contribute to the male predominance of severe infections and
      given that TMPRSS2 has no known indispensable functions, and inhibitors are available, it is
      an appealing target for prevention or treatment of respiratory viral infections

      MPRSS2, a key regulatorin prostate cancerTMPRSS2 was first identified in prostate cancer
      shortly after the gene had been originally cloned. Prostate cancer cell linesstrongly
      upregulatedTMPRSS2expression in response to androgens . TMPRSS2 is expressed on the luminal
      side of the prostate epithelium, and its expression is increased in prostate cancer tissue
      compared to non-cancerous prostate tissue. Notably, the TMPRSS2gene is a partner in one of
      the most common gene fusion eventsin solid tumors: somatic gene rearrangements involving
      TMPRSS2 witha member of the ETS family of oncogenic transcription factors, most commonly ERG.
      This fusionoccursinapproximately 50% of primary prostate cancersamong men of European
      ancestry.While ERGis not normally regulated by androgen, the gene fusion juxtaposes the
      androgen receptor regulatory elements of TMPRSS2with the ERGgene. The ERGgene is consequently
      controlled by androgen receptor signaling and expressed highly in prostate cancers
      harboringthe TMPRSS2:ERGfusion. Intriguingly, the prevalence of the TMPRSS2:ERGfusion is
      lowerin prostate tumors of both black and Asian men. The relevance of this to the current
      COVID-19 pandemic is unclear.TMPRSS2:ERGfusion-positiveprostate cancersalso have a distinct
      set of risk factorsrelated to hormonal signaling. For example, men with higher genetically
      determined transcriptional activity of the androgen receptorhave a higher risk of
      TMPRSS2:ERGfusion-positiveprostate cancer but not of fusion-negativeprostate cancer

      TMPRSS2 is an androgen receptor signaling target gene and an androgen-regulated cell-surface
      serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell TMPRSS2 is
      normally expressed several fold higher in the prostate relative to any other human tissue,
      though the normal physiological function(s) remains unknown. Importantly, unlike other TTSPs,
      TMPRSS2 transcription is regulated by androgenic ligands and the androgen receptor (AR).
      There is a positive correlation between AR and TMPRSS2 in microdissected primary tumor
      epithelium (r2 = 0.39 ; p &lt;0.001).

      Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly and dramatically induced the expression of TMPRSS2
      protein with two molecular masses of 60 (full-length) and 38 kDa (N-terminus) in a dose
      responsive manner

      Data from Chinese outbreak show death rates for men almost 50 per cent higher than for women
      show that Early research from China suggests women and children are less likely to die than
      men if they catch the coronavirus. Death rates for Covid-19, the disease those infected with
      the coronavirus develop, are low for everyone: only 2.4 per cent of the 44,672 people in the
      Chinese study died. But although roughly even numbers of men and women catch the disease, men
      are more likely to develop such a serious case of Covid-19 they die.

      More than 70 percent of Italy's coronavirus deaths have been among men but scientists there
      admit they are mystified by the gender gap. At least 3,400 people in Italy have died of the
      devastating disease - it yesterday announced it had a higher death Toll than China - but less
      than 1,000 of them have been women. Men are also more likely to pick up the infection in the
      first place and account for 60 percent of confirmed cases, according to Italy's public health
      research agency. An earlier analysis found that 80 per cent of the deaths were in men and
      just 20 per cent were in women - but the gap has narrowed over time

      According to this data the principal investigator thinks that there is a strong relation
      between high mortality in males and androgenic effect specifically the effect of DHT on
      TMPRSS2 protein which is used by covid 2019 in cell invasion and entry and depending on this
      data related to six hormones specifically (DHT) , The investigator was able to discover whey
      women and children less likely to die from illness than men. So, the investigator divided
      infected patients according to their six hormone because TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated
      cell-surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell
      TMPRSS2.

      Androgen(DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in children is less than its effect in
      females and males followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with children and
      women. .

      Androgen (DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in females is less than in males
      followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with females .

      So, the principal investigator thinks that when some researchers investigated the role of sex
      steroids in SARS-CoV pathogenesis by comparing gonadectomized and control counterparts after
      infection. Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide, a non-steroidal anti-androgen did not
      affect morbidity and mortality in male mice following lethal MA15 infection, They may be were
      wrong in their conclusions in suggesting that androgens do not play a role in SARS-CoV
      pathogenesis because Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide will not completely affect or
      inhibit DHT and its derivatives(5α-Androstan-3α,17β-Diol) concentration in tissues and blood
      because after inhibiting testosterone with flutamide . the pathway of DHT formation will be
      activated to compensate the inhibited testosterone levels so the TMPRSS2 expression will be
      significantly induced by DHT and the treated animals will not be affected in case of
      flutamide treatment but in case of Gonadectomy the expression of TMPRSS2 will be decreased by
      DHT inhibition only if along time has passed on Gonadectomy in order to make sure that DHT
      and its derivatives completely declined in levels that will not allow it to affect on
      expression of TMPRSS2 and in female mice after blocking estrogen receptors it died because
      increasing formation of androgenic hormones.

      A study demonstrated that 13- cis -Retinoic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits
      Dihydrotestosterone So, the principal investigator expects a significant modulation of
      TMPRSS2 expression after treating with 13- cis -Retinoic acid via temporary preventing the
      effect of dihydrotestosterone(DHT) on TMPRSS2 promoting and expression. And the type II
      transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 which can cleave and activate the spike protein (S) of
      the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) for membrane fusion. In
      addition, these proteases cleave the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and it was proposed that ACE2 cleavage augments viral
      infectivity.

      A study demonstrated that COVID-19 reduces testosterone levels in men by altering the
      functioning of the gonads. So could the increased severity of the disease in men be due to
      lowered testosterone. But according to the principal investigator explanation COVID-19
      reduces testosterone levels because there is a dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels
      of patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls . Cholesterol levels
      decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection and increase as the patient starts
      to recover.Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may have an important role to play in
      defending the body against such infections and depending on the principal investigator
      explanation, Testosterone is synthesized starting from cholesterol through a
      well-characterized steroid biosynthetic pathway involving the sequential action of multiple
      enzymes So, when cholesterol levels are decreased, this decrease will followed by decreasing
      in testosterone level and according to this explanation testosterone therapy in COVID 2019 is
      not recommended but temporary inhibitor of DHT is recommended such as Isotretinoin because
      this treatment by testosterone will inhibit cholesterol synthesis by feedback inhibition and
      decrease cholesterol uptake by Leydig cells in testis and this also will lead to over
      increase in DHT lvels and its derivatives in different tissues, which will induce TMPRSS2.
      because DHT is a potent activator of TMPRSS2 and this will be followed by processing and
      activation of COVID2019 spike protein to bined its ACE2 receptors in lung and kidney leading
      to their damage specifically in testis because it contains high levels of proteases and ACE2.
      Serine proteases are emerging as important contributors to the production, maturation, and
      functional competence of spermatozoa.

      Depending on this data and according to this protocol, The principal investigator expects and
      suggests that retinoic acid is specific modulator of androgens specifically DHT not
      testosterone and could reverse the androgenic induction and activation effect of (DHT) on
      TMPRSS2 expression and prevent cleaving and activating both the spike protein (S) of COVID
      2019 and the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
      (All ideas and michanisms specifically role of Androgen in TMPRSS2 activation in COVID-19:
      Serendipity or opportunity for intervention and the inhibition of ACE2 ,AT1 protein and Ang
      II-mediated intracellular calcium release pathway which is responsible for SARS-CoV-2 cell
      fusion and entry included in the research protocol were submitted to Academy of scientific
      research and technology - Egypt- on 4 April , 2020. in Call no. 2/2019/ASRT- Ideation Fund)

      Promising features of COVID 2019 treatment according Principal Investigator Protocol:

        1. This medication have the feature of Aerosolized Drug Delivery to increase its efficacy
           beside Oral administration, Which makes it distinct from other medication in which
           should dose be only given orally. A study demonstrated that treating with 13 cis
           retinoic acid aerosolized via inhalation rout did not cause any damage in lung cells.
           Repeated high doses of 13 cis retinoic by inhalation resulted in moderate loss of body
           weight, but microscopic investigation of ten tissues including lung and oesophagus did
           not detect any significant aerosol-induced damage. The results suggest that
           administration of isotretinoin via powder aerosol inhalation is probably superior to its
           application via the oral route in terms of achieving efficacious drug concentrations in
           the lung.

        2. Inhaled isotretinoin might provide sufficient drug to the target cells for efficacy
           while avoiding systemic toxicity.

        3. A study demonstrated that 13 cis retinoic is used in treating Emphysema (emphysema is a
           lung condition that causes shortness of breath)

        4. ATRA has been reported to induce formation of new alveoli and returns elastic recoil in
           the lung to approximately normal values in animal models of emphysema.

        5. Strong expectation of complete COVID 2019 blockade from cell entry and infection
           depending on strong ethics, researches and references.

        6. Availability of our compounds.

        7. Ease of application.

        8. Expectation of COVID 2019 treating of by more than one distinct mechanism.

        9. Expectation of High induction of anti- inflammatory T cells and significant inhibition
           of IL-6 at low concentrations.

       10. Controlling Accompanying cytokine storm.

       11. No interactions with Egyptian protocol drugs were found.
