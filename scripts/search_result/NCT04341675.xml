    <textblock>
      The main objective of our study is to determine if treatment with sirolimus can improve
      clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We will employ a randomized, double
      blind, placebo-controlled study design. 30 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to
      receive sirolimus or placebo. Sirolimus will be given as a 6mg oral loading dose on day 1
      followed by 2mg daily for a maximum treatment duration of 14 days or until hospital
      discharge, whichever happens sooner. Chart reviews will be conducted daily to determine
      changes in clinical status, concomitant medications and laboratory parameters. Study specific
      biomarkers will be measured at baseline and then at days 3, 7 and 14.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects enrolled in the trial must meet all of the following criteria.

          -  Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia or high likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia as suggested by
             the presence of: a) bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, b) fever &gt;100 degrees Fahrenheit,
             c) negative URI PCR for other viral pathogens (if performed per clinical indications),
             and d) serum procalcitonin ≤0.25ng/mL

          -  Hypoxia as defined by room air oxygen saturation less than 90% or supplemental oxygen
             requirement

          -  Presence of at least one additional biomarker that has been shown to predict poor
             prognosis: a) serum ferritin ≥500ug/l, b) LDH ≥250U/L, c) d-dimer ≥1ug/L, or d)
             lymphopenia as defined by absolute lymphocyte count &lt;1,000/uL

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Completed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet ANY of the following criteria are not eligible for enrollment as study
        participants:

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to sirolimus

          -  Inability or refusal to provide informed consent

          -  Advanced respiratory support (high flow oxygen ≥ 15 L/min, CPAP, non-invasive or
             invasive mechanical ventilation)

          -  Active enrollment in other interventional clinical drug trials. Co-enrollment in
             observational studies and biorepositories is allowed.

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Breast feeding

          -  On chronic immunosuppression for other medical conditions such as rheumatological
             disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, or in patients with organ transplants. A list
             of these medications is provided in Section 12.3.4

          -  Any clinically significant medical disease which in the opinion of the investigator
             precludes the patient from enrolling in the trial, including (but not limited to):

               -  History of liver cirrhosis

               -  End stage renal disease or need for renal replacement therapy

               -  Decompensated heart failure

               -  Known active tuberculosis or history of incompletely treated tuberculosis

               -  Uncontrolled systemic bacterial or fungal infections

               -  Active viral infection other than COVID-19
