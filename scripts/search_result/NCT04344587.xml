  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prone positioning is a well studied and validated treatment for severe acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS), however there are no randomized studies on the use of prone
      positioning in the non-intubated patient. The purpose of this trial is to investigate the use
      of prone positioning in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who are not intubated. It is unknown if
      this intervention would be helpful in preventing further respiratory deterioration in terms
      of increasing supplemental oxygen requirements, endotracheal intubation, and ICU admission.
      The CATNAP Study is a pragmatic adaptive randomized controlled unblinded trial. CATNAP
      compares a smartphone tool that recommends non-ICU patients with COVID-19 or who are under
      evaluation for COVID-19 to lie in a prone position (i.e, with their stomach and chest facing
      down) to usual care.
