             presenting with lower respiratory tract infection.

          7. Subsequent infusion CYNK-001 on Days 4 and 7 will be provided only if no toxicity ≥
             Grade 3 either related or unrelated to CYNK-001 is observed for each patient. If any
             such ≥ Grade 3 toxicity is observed, the second and third doses will be delayed until
             the noted event is resolved to Grade 1 toxicity level.

             a. *FCBP is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone
             a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal
             (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at
             least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24
             consecutive months).

         14. Male patients must agree to use a condom during sexual contact for at least 28 days

             signing ICF.

          7. Patient is receiving antiviral therapy with known or suspected activity against
             COVID-19 including remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, sofosbuvir, or redeliver at time

                  in the past year prior to infection. (It is anticipated that the infection may
                  impact renal function.)

               3. Patient has a bilirubin level &gt; 2 mg/dL (unless patient has known Gilbert's
                  Syndrome).

         10. Patient has a known sensitivity or allergy to treatment additives or diluent

             3 years from the date of signing the ICF. Exceptions include the following noninvasive
             malignancies:
