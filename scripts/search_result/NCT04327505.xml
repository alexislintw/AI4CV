  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is safe for patients with COVID-19 and that HBO
      reduces the inflammatory reaction in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) associated
      with COVID-19.

      Also known as SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 is declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO).
      No specific treatment has been successful as of March 2020. Mortality rates in patients that
      develop ARDS is extremely high, 61.5-90%, almost double the mortality of ARDS of any cause.
      ARDS associated with COVID-19 is associated with pulmonary edema, rapidly progressing
      respiratory failure and fibrosis. The mechanism behind the rapid progress is still an enigma
      but theories have evolved around severe inflammatory involvement with a cytokine storm.
      Macrophage activation is involved in the early phase of ARDS and cytokine modulators have
      been tried in experimental settings without proven clinical benefits. HBO significantly
      reduces inflammatory cytokines and and oedema in other clinical settings. HBO has been used
      for almost a century, nowadays mainly used for its anti-inflammatory effects. Several
      randomized clinical trials show beneficial effects in variety of inflammatory diseases
      including diabetic foot ulcers and radiation injury. HBO is generally regarded as safe with
      very few adverse events and extensive experimental and clinical evidence suggest that HBO is
      a promising drug to ameliorate ARDS associated with COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 also known as CoV-2 is declared a pandemic by WHO. More than 400 articles have been
      published and more than 160 clinical trials are registered but no specific treatment has been
      successful as of March 2020. Antiviral drugs Lopinavir-Ritonavir did not show any significant
      benefit compared to standard care in a Chinese randomized controlled study with 199 patients.
      Even though the overall mortality is low (0.2-7.2% the figures from critical care are
      fearsome. Mortality rates have been reported as high as 90% in patients developing Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in early reports from the Wuhan province and more recent
      reports has reported overall 28-d mortality rates of 61,5% in ICU patients with acute
      respiratory illness (ALI), almost double the mortality of ARDS of any cause. ARDS associated
      with COVID-19 differs from other described ARDS with rapidly progressing respiratory failure
      and fibrosis. The mechanism behind the rapid progress is still an enigma but theories have
      evolved around severe inflammatory involvement with a cytokine storm. Macrophage activation
      is involved in the early phase of ARDS and cytokine modulators such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6)
      inhibitors have been tried in experimental settings but no proper clinical trials have proven
      positive outcome. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) significantly reduces inflammatory cytokines
      including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α through several transcription factors regulating
      inflammation, including Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1), Nrf2 and NFkB. Hyperbaric oxygen
      (HBO) has been used for almost a century, initially for decompression sickness, but it
      nowadays mainly used for its anti-inflammatory effects. Several randomized clinical trials
      have been conducted on humans for a variety of inflammatory diseases including diabetic foot
      ulcers and radiation injury. HBO is generally regarded as safe with very few adverse events.
      The broad and physiological anti-inflammatory effects of HBO shown in extensive experimental
      and clinical evidence suggest that HBO is a promising drug to ameliorate ARDS associated with
      COVID-19.
