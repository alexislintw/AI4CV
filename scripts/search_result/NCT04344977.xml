  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus
      named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causes substantial
      morbidity and mortality. There is currently no vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2
      or therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. The objective of this protocol is the identification
      of eligible donors and collection of anti-SARSCoV-2 immune plasma from convalescent survivors
      of COVID-19 illness.

      Potential subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in plasma donations and
      their blood measured for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled subjects will receive a baseline
      physical and laboratory examination. Subjects with high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody
      titers who meet standard blood bank criteria for plasma donation will then be scheduled for
      plasma collection sessions. Following testing of the collected plasma for potential
      pathogens, this plasma may be used and/or converted into an intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
      preparation for further study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study procedures.

          2. Age ≥ 18 years old and ≤ 70 years old.

          3. Females must have both of the following:

               -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential only).

               -  Negative anti-HLA screening test (to reduce risk of transfusion-related acute
                  lung injury [TRALI] in plasma recipients, which is associated with antibodies
                  found in some plasma from females and is likely generated during pregnancy).

          4. Subjects must not be symptomatic, must be afebrile for ≥14 days, beyond 28 days of the
             resolution of their acute illness, and must enroll within 18 months of onset of
             illness, and must meet at least 1 of the following:

               -  History suggestive of resolved COVID-19 like illness (e.g., prior fever, dry
                  cough, and shortness of breath). OR

               -  History of positive test for SARS-CoV-2 (either serologic or RT-PCR) OR

               -  Current participation in a protocol for plasmapheresis and an anti-SARS-CoV-2
                  neutralizing antibody titer of at least 1:80

          5. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer of at least 1:80

          6. Weight ≥ 110 pounds (50 kg)

          7. Meets FDA-approved criteria of local blood collector for plasmapheresis for plasma
             donation

          8. Adequate peripheral venous access for plasma donation (as judged by the examiner)

          9. Willingness to have samples stored

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any sign of active illness of any kind including COVID-19 illness (as judged by the
             investigator), including but not limited to:

               -  Subjective or documented fever (≥38°C)

               -  Dry cough

               -  Shortness of breath

          2. Participation in medical research that includes:

               -  Protocols that are currently ongoing or will start during the duration of this
                  study that require more than 100 mL of blood to be given in any 8-week period of
                  time

               -  Administration of any unlicensed drug within the last 3 months or during the
                  duration of this study

               -  Administration of any unlicensed vaccine within the last 12 months or during the
                  duration of this study.

          3. Subjects that have participated in previous plasma collection or other cell component
             collection procedures within the last 3 months may have restrictions to participation
             based on the site plasma collection SOP. In this scenario, discussion should occur
             with the blood establishment to ensure eligibility to donate plasma.
