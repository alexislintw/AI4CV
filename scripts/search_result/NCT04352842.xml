      The pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) has become a global
      health crisis and caused many casualties. Although acute respiratory syndrome is the main
      manifestation of the disease, the understanding of the impact of the virus on other organs is
      of very importance in terms of the treatment, especially for patients with severe or critical
      conditions. Some studies have reported that a certain percentage of patients presented
      cardiac injury as indicated by elevated cardiac biomarkers and B-type natriuretic peptide
      (BNP) as well as abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) . However, it is less known whether cardiac
      functions will be remarkably affected in these patients. Therefore, this study measured
      echocardiographic indexes of a cohort of patients admitted of COVID-19 in a designated
      hospital in Wuhan, China, aiming to provide referential information for medical staff
      fighting the disease in the front line.
