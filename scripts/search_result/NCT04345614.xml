  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label randomized controlled study will evaluate safety, efficacy, and the
      pharmacokinetic profile of CM4620-IE in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Forty
      patients on low flow oxygen and forty patients on high flow oxygen will receive 2.0 mg/kg of
      CM4620-IE by continuous IV infusion on Day 1, followed by 1.6 mg/kg for days 2 and 3. Another
      20 patients of each will receive local standard of care only. The infusion of CM4620-IE will
      start within 8 hours from the time the patient or LAR provides informed consent.

    <description>The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at a given day. Each day, the worst score from the previous day will be recorded. The scale is as follows: 1. Death 2. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO 3. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices 4. Hospitalized, requiring low flow supplemental oxygen 5. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care (other than per protocol study drug administration) 7. Not hospitalized</description>
