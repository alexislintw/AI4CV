  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to collect dietary intake, physical activity, mood and stress
      data during and after the Illinois shelter-in-place and social distancing orders for the
      COVID-19 pandemic. The study's intent is to capture data during this unprecedented time to
      understand the non-infection consequences of social distancing and shelter-in-place,
      including duration of affect after orders are lifted.

      The proposed study is an observational study. The study will include our previous subjects,
      those who are following the shelter- in- place order due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
      Demographic data of the individuals participating in the study will be recorded. During this
      12-month protocol, participants will be contacted through email to complete online
      questionnaires on weekly basis for 8 weeks, and then once every 4 weeks until the end of the
      study. Subjects will record their one-day food intake, physical activity, eating behavior,
      and stress and anxiety level, which takes ~1 hour to complete.

      Subjects will be recruited through our CNRC databases of individuals who come to our clinic
      in the past 1 year, online advertisement, and word of mouth. A phone and/or email will be
      administered to ensure their eligibility using our standard tools and protocols. Subjects who
      are willing and able to participate and meet the basic screening eligibility will be
      contacted through email for inform consent and the continuing of the study.
