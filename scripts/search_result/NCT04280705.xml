  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with
      COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 75
      sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a
      control arm. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping
      for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this
      treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s).
      Any such change would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background standards
      of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful
      management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from
      concurrently randomized subjects. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will
      actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to
      study arms. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Discharged subjects will be
      asked to attend study visits at Days 15 and 29. All subjects will undergo a series of
      efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. The primary objective of the study is to
      evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics relative to the
      control arm in adults hospitalized with COVID-19.

      of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful
      management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from
      concurrently randomized subjects. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will
      actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to
      study arms. The initial sample size is calculated to be approximately 440 subjects, and if
      any additional therapeutic arms are added, the sample size will be recalculated. Subjects
      will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Discharged subjects will be asked to attend study
      visits at Days 15 and 29. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and
      laboratory assessments. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical
      efficacy of different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm in adults
      hospitalized with COVID-19. The secondary objectives of the study are to 1) evaluate the
      clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics as compared to the control arm as
      assessed by clinical severity, hospitalization, and mortality, and 2) evaluate the safety of
      different investigational therapeutics as compared to the control arm.

               -  Requiring mechanical ventilation.

          8. Women of childbearing potential must agree to either abstinence or use at least one
             primary form of contraception not including hormonal contraception from the time of
             screening through Day 29.

          9. Agrees to not participate in another clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 or
             SARS-CoV-2 through Day 29.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Alanine Transaminase (ALT)/Aspartate Transaminase (AST) &gt; 5 times the upper limit of
             normal.

          2. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 50 or requiring dialysis.

          3. Pregnancy or breast feeding.

          4. Anticipated transfer to another hospital which is not a study site within 72 hours.
