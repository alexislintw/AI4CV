    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      etoposide in patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. Treatment will be
      comprised of etoposide administered intravenously at a dose of 150 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 4 as
      prevention of cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19 infection.

      This is a single arm, open label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      etoposide in patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. Treatment will be
      comprised of etoposide administered intravenously at a dose of 150 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 4 as
      prevention of cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19 infection.

      The rationale for the use of etoposide to treat the cytokine storm in COVID-19 is the high
      mortality associated with the hyperinflammatory response to the virus, which is similar to
      that seen in other secondary types of Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Early use of
      etoposide has been shown to improve survival in secondary Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
      Etoposide is an already FDA approved drug that is comparably inexpensive and currently
      available. At Boston Medical Center, the investigators are trending daily inflammatory
      markers in patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19. The investigators propose a Phase
      II study of etoposide for the prevention and treatment of cytokine storm in severe COVID-19
      infection.
