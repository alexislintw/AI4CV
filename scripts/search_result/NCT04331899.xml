      To evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous injections of 180 ug of Peginterferon Lambda-1a once
      weekly, for up to two weeks (2 injections at most), compared with standard supportive care,
      in reducing the duration of oral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients with uncomplicated
      COVID-19 disease.
