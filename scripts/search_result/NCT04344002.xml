  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre study on lung cancer patients which experienced COVID-19. Information
      on clinical features, clinical course, management and outcomes will be collected for both,
      thoracic cancers and COVID-19 infection. Firstly, investigators will be registered in an
      online secure registry. After that, a protocol will be developed in order to collect clinical
      data for the research. It will also include I on the care organization or the perception of
      the patient and their family members.

      The final stage will consist on retrospective data collection from patients. So, it is a
      retrospective study data collection, preceded by prospective data registry.
