    <textblock>
      COVID-19 infection is a respiratory infectious disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2 .
      This virus is transmitted from person to person through close contacts or respiratory
      droplets. Symptoms usually start 4 or 5 days after exposure. Some common symptoms include
      fever, dry cough, feeling tired, muscle aches, and trouble breathing. Although it may affect
      all organs in our body, it mainly attacks our lungs' ability to help us breathe.

      There are currently no FDA approved medications to treat COVID-19 infection. Patients are
      given medications to help alleviate the symptoms. When patients are admitted to the hospital,
      they are given medications to reduce fever, relieve pain and supplement oxygen. In severe
      cases, patients are put on a ventilator, a machine designed to to support the lungs. There
      are a number of drugs undergoing clinical study to see if they are effective in treating the
      COVID-19 virus.

      At Maimonides Medical Center, the investigators are taking the appropriate steps to find an
      effective treatment for COVID-19. The COMBAT COVID-19 Pilot Study is designed for patients
      diagnosed with COVID-19 infection who require oxygen supplementation to be treated with
      colchicine to reduce the chance of needing a mechanical ventilator.

      Colchicine is an FDA approved medication that is used to treat inflammatory disorders such as
      Gout and Familial Mediterranean Fever. It has also been used to treat other inflammatory
      conditions such as inflammation around the heart and been demonstrated to help patients who
      have had an acute heart attack. Colchicine is a readily available drug which is usually well
      tolerated by patients. The investigators believe that colchicine may reduce the inflammation
      in the lungs. If so, the lungs may be able heal at a quicker pace and we hope that this may
      reduce the need for mechanical ventilation.

      The research will be a randomized trial, patient will be randomly selected to be in either
      the colchicine treatment group or the standard medicines group. The treatment group will
      receive colchicine for 14 days or until the day of discharge. The standard medicines group
      will receive the usual medical therapy as determined by attending physician.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      To demonstrate that Colchicine in moderate/high-risk COVID patients:

        1. Reduces the need for oxygen supplementation beyond 8L nasal cannula

        2. Reduces the need for mechanical ventilation

        3. Reduces max troponin elevations

        4. Reduces inflammatory markers

        5. Reduces length of hospitalization

        6. Reduces mortality

      HYPOTHESIS The investigators hypothesize that treatment with colchicine in COVID-19
      moderate/high-risk patients may decrease the risk of progression into ARDS requiring
      increased oxygen requirements, mechanical ventilation, and mortality.

      STUDY DESIGN Prospective, completely randomized, open labeled, controlled study. Patients
      will be randomized into two groups (A and B). Patients of group A will be treated under what
      is considered current standard of care at Maimonides Medical Center while group B patients
      will receive colchicine in addition to standard of care.

      Treatment arm

      In addition to the local standard of care for COVID 19 patients, the patient will receive
      colchicine PO as such:

        -  Loading dose of 1.2 mg followed by 0.6mg after 2 hours if without significant
           gastrointestinal symptoms (day 1)

        -  The next day 0.6mg bid for 14 days or until discharge

      Patients who are on HMG-Co A Reductase Inhibitors (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin,
      simvastatin), fibrates, genfibrozil, amiodarone, dronedarone or digoxin should have the
      colchicine dosage reduced to a loading dose of 0.6mg followed by 0.3mg after two hours (day
      1) followed by 0.3mg BID for 14 days or until discharge.

      If patients have significant gastrointestinal symptoms after loading, the dosage may be
      reduced to 0.3mg BID for the rest of the 14 day course or until discharge. If
      gastrointestinal symptoms continue, the medication should then be discontinued. Patients who
      experience sensory motor neuropathy, or symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with
      rhabdomyolysis should prompt immediate discontinuation of the drug. If renal function
      deteriorates during the treatment course and CrCl &lt;30ml/min, colchicine should also be
      discontinued.

      Control arm Usual medical therapy (can include medications such as hydroxychloroquine,
      azithromycin)

      Patients should NOT receive Steroids (IV/PO), Remdesivir, IL-6 inhibitors (Tociluzimab,
      Sarilumab), JAK inhibitors, IL-1 inhibitors, or other immunomodulators for COVID-19 after
      randomization while not intubated. Since the primary clinical endpoint is progression of
      disease, if the patient requires mechanical ventilation, the primary clinical endpoint is met
      and the above experimental salvage medications will be permitted. To rephrase, the patient
      will be allowed steroids, Remdesivir, IL-6 inhibitors and other immunomodulators only after
      intubation if deemed medically necessary by the treating physician.

      Design: The pilot study is a prospective randomized study involving colchicine in the
      experimental arm. The study will be performed in the inpatient wards at Maimonides Medical
      Center.

      Data Collection Procedures: Data will be collected from Sunrise Clinical Manager Electronic
      records at Maimonides Medical Center.

      Patients with COVID-19 infection are usually assessed with laboratory tests to determine
      their inflammatory state. Markers such as CRP, troponin, LDH and Ferritin, and IL6 level are
      used routinely during the patient's hospitalization. These markers are also frequently
      repeated during the hospitalization to gauge a patient's clinical status. At the time of
      study randomization, a set of these markers will be obtained if not already obtained in the
      prior 24 hours. We recommend clinical follow up of these markers as medically indicated by
      the treating physician. We recommend ascertainment of a peak troponin elevation during the
      hospitalization and peak CRP as would be expected in standard medical care.

      Biochemical end points

        -  Maximum troponin elevation

        -  Maximum CRP; Time (days) from colchicine initiation to achieve CRP &lt;1

      Clinical end points

        -  PRIMARY:

           ○ Percentage of patients who require escalation of supplemental oxygen beyond low-flow
           nasal cannula (&gt;8L/min)

        -  SECONDARY:

             -  Percentage of patients who will require mechanical ventilation

             -  Hospital length of stay

             -  Mortality

      Safety Monitoring The investigators anticipate colchicine to have an excellent safety profile
      given the medication's widespread use in the outpatient and inpatient setting. However
      outcome data at each 20 patients will be evaluated to ensure there are no adverse events
      which would would necessitate pausing or discontinuation of the study. A signal for adverse
      events will be discussed internally with the investigators and reported to the IRB. Serious
      adverse events will be reported within 24 hours to the IRB.
