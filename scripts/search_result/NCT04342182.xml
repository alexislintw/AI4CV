  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Passive immunization with immunoglobulins is occasionally used as therapy for the treatment
      of viral infectious diseases. Immunoglobulins are used for the treatment of CMV disease, and
      is effective as prophylaxis when given soon after exposure to varicella zoster virus, rabies,
      and hepatitis B virus.

      Neutralizing antibodies against MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to be present
      in patients previously infected with MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 respectively. During the
      2003 SARS outbreak in Hong-Kong,a non-randomized study in hospitalized SARS patients showed
      that treatment with convalescent plasma (convP) from SARS-recovered donors significantly
      increased the day 22 discharge rate and decreased mortality. A study in non-human primates
      showed that rhesus macaques could not be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 after primary infection.

      With no proven effective therapy against COVID-19, this protocol will evaluate the
      therapeutic potential of therapy with convalescent plasma from COVID-19 recovered donors.

      Primary objectives

      • Decrease overall mortality in patients within COVID disease

      Study design:

      This trial is a randomized comparative trial. Patients will be randomized between the
      infusion of 250mL of convP with standard of care.

      Patient population:

      Patients with PCR confirmed COVID disease, age &gt;18 years Donors will be included with a known
      history of COVID who have been asymptomatic for at least 24 hours.

      Intervention: 250mL of convP Duration of treatment: ConvP will be given as a one-time
      infusion Duration of follow up: Until discharge or death before day 60, whichever comes first

      Target number of patients: 426 Target number of donors: 100

      Secondary (exploratory) objectives

        -  Evaluate the effect of 250ml convP on hospital stay

        -  Evaluate the effect of 250ml convP on mortality in patients admitted to the ICU

        -  Evaluate the effect of 250ml plasma therapy on hospital days for patients admitted to
           the ICU within 24 hours after admission

        -  Evaluate the impact of plasma therapy on the decrease in SARS-CoV2 shedding from airways
