      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether the therapy with chloroquine phosphate (CQ, in
      combination with telemedical approach) in addition to standard care is effective and safe in
      reducing composite endpoint of COVID-19-related hospitalization or all cause death, in
      ambulatory patients with SARS-SoV-2 infection at particular risk of serious complications due
      to advanced age and/or comorbid conditions (in comparison with subjects not treated with CQ
      but receiving standard care and supervised telemedically).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until now there are no evidence-based, good-quality data from sufficiently powered clinical
      trials supporting the use of any antiviral medicines or immunomodulatory therapies in the
      management or prophylaxis of COVID-19; however there are currently being initiated studies in
      Europe and U.S., and a few registered studies are ongoing in China. Currently two groups of
      medicines are hypothesized to be effective therapeutic options in COVID-19: (1) classical
      antiviral drugs interfering with pathogen dissemination / replication, and (2) compounds
      inhibiting host inflammatory reactions, especially (and potentially selectively) in
      respiratory tract / system (cytokine inhibitors and specific antibodies). Special hopes are
      placed in quinoline derivatives such as chloroquine (CQ), based on some unpublished data from
      China and a few experiments in vitro. CQ is an old antimalarial drug that has been used for
      more than 50 years in the therapy and prevention of this parasitosis. Anti-inflammatory
      features of quinolone derivatives such as CQ or hydroxychloroquine have also been used in
      rheumatology (for the therapy of lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis) due to the
      inhibition of the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The effectiveness (and safety) of
      CQ in COVID-19 has not been investigated in sufficiently powered RCTs until now.
