  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of treatment with high-titer Anti- SARS-CoV-2 plasma
      (convalescent plasma) versus control (standard plasma) in patients with COVID-19 respiratory
      symptoms.

      This study will recruit patients who present for clinical evaluation in the emergency
      department (ED) but who do not require hospital admission. Disease progression due to
      COVID-19 will be assessed, which may include changes in symptom severity, return visit to the
      ED, or hospital admission.

    <description>Progression of disease is defined as any of the following:
Patient admitted to the hospital
Patient seen in the emergency room (return visit after visit when enrollment takes place)
Patient reports increased symptoms of 2 levels on the COVID Outpatient Ordinal Outcomes Scale over a 24 hour period
Patient reports increased symptoms of 1 level on the COVID Outpatient Ordinal Outcomes Scale observed for a 48 hour period.
COVID Outpatient Ordinal Outcomes Scale:
Patient requires care in the hospital
Patient requires care in the ED or urgent care
Patient at home with symptoms rates as moderate (defined as fever, shortness of breath, abdominal pain)
Patient at home with symptoms rated as mild (defined as afebrile, constitutional symptoms (flu-like illness) without shortness of breath)
Patient in their usual state of health</description>

    <description>Categorical change in symptom severity rated on the COVID Outpatient Ordinal Outcomes Scale:
Patient requires care in the hospital
