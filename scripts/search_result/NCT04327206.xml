  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open label, two-group, phase III randomised controlled trial in up to 4170 healthcare workers
      to determine if BCG vaccination reduces the incidence and severity of COVID-19 during the
      2020 pandemic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare workers are at the frontline of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
      Participants will be healthcare workers in Australian hospital sites. They will be randomised
      to receive a single dose of BCG vaccine, or no BCG vaccine. Participants will be followed-up
      for 12 months with regular mobile phone text messages (up to weekly) and surveys to identify
      and detail COVID-19 infection. Additional information on severe disease will be obtained from
      hospital medical records and government databases. Blood samples will be collected prior to
      randomisation and at 12 months to determine exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Where required, swab/blood samples will be taken at illness
      episodes to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Over 18 years of age

          -  Employed by one of the hospitals involved in the study

          -  Provide a signed and dated informed consent form

          -  Pre-randomisation blood collected

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has any BCG vaccine contraindication

          -  Fever or generalised skin infection (where feasible, randomisation can be delayed
             until cleared)

          -  Weakened resistance toward infections due to a disease in/of the immune system

          -  Receiving medical treatment that affects the immune response or other
             immunosuppressive therapy in the last year. These therapies include systemic
             corticosteroids (more than or equal to 20 mg for more than or equal to 2 weeks),
             non-biological immunosuppressant (also known as 'DMARDS'), biological agents (such as
             monoclonal antibodies against tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha).

          -  Has a congenital cellular immunodeficiency, including specific deficiencies of the
             interferon-gamma pathway

          -  Has a malignancy involving bone marrow or lymphoid systems

          -  Has any serious underlying illness (such as malignancy). Please note: People with
             cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and/or chronic respiratory disease are
             eligible if not immunocompromised

          -  Known or suspected HIV infection, even if asymptomatic or has normal immune function.
             This is because of the risk of disseminated BCG infection

          -  Has active skin disease such as eczema, dermatitis or psoriasis at or near the site of
             vaccination. A different site (other than left arm) can be chosen if necessary

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding Although there is no evidence that BCG vaccination is
             harmful during pregnancy or breastfeeding, it is a contra-indication to BCG
             vaccination. Therefore, we will exclude women who think they could be pregnant.

          -  Another live vaccine administered in the month prior to randomisation

          -  Require another live vaccine to be administered within the month following BCG
             randomisation If the other live vaccine can be given on the same day, this exclusion
             criteria does not apply

          -  Known anaphylactic reaction to any of the ingredient present in the BCG vaccine

          -  BCG vaccine given within the last year

          -  Has previously had a SARS-CoV-2 positive test result

          -  Already part of this trial, recruited at a different hospital
