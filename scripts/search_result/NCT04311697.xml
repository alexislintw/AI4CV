  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) is known to cause Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress
      Syndrome, that results in death of approximately 80% of those who develop ARDS, despite
      intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Patients with COVID-19 induced Acute Respiratory
      Distress Syndrome who are admitted for intensive care including endotracheal intubation and
      mechanical ventilation will be treated with Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Human Vasoactive
      Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) plus maximal intensive care vs. placebo + maximal intensive
      care. Patients will be randomized to intravenous Aviptadil will receive escalating doses from
      50 -150 pmol/kg/hr over 12 hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Lung Injury, which causes Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a known lethal
      complication of Corona Virus (COVID-19) infection. Conventional medical therapy, including
      intensive care and respiratory support is associated with an 80% mortality. Aviptadil, a
      synthetic form of Human Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA Orphan
      Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and admitted to the FDA CoronaVirus Technology
      Accelerator Program.

      Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung, where it
      prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits IL6 and TNFa production,
      protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, These and other effects have been observed in
      numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and
      dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar
      interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure.

      Aviptadil is approved for human use in Europe and has a demonstrated 20 year history of
      safety in phase 2 trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, Erectile Dysfunction,
      and a phase I trial in ARDS. In that phase I trial, 8 patients with severe ARDS on mechanical
      ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP. Seven of the 8 patients were
      successfully extubated and were alive at the five day timepoint. Six left the hospital and
      one died of an unrelated cardiac event.

      Five phase 2 trials of aviptadil have been conducted under European regulatory authority.
      Numerous healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well
      tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or
      ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded
      basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores
      function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI).

      In this study, patients who are hospitalized and intubated for ARDS secondary to COVID-19
      infection will be randomly allocated to Aviptadil administered by intravenous infusion in
      addition to maximal intensive care vs. maximal intensive care alone. Primary endpoints will
      be improvement in blood oxygenation and mortality.
