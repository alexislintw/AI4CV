  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial that will be conducted in
      health care settings. After obtaining fully informed consent, the investigator will recruit
      healthcare workers, or other individuals at significant risk who can be followed reliably for
      5 months. 40,000 participants will be recruited and the investigator predict an average of
      400-800 participants per site in 50-100 sites.

      The participant will be randomised to receive either chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine or
      placebo (1:1 randomisation). A loading dose of 10mg base/kg, followed by 155 mg daily (250mg
      chloroquine phosphate salt or 200mg hydroxychloroquine sulphate) will be taken for 3 months.
      Subsequent episodes of symptomatic respiratory illness, including symptomatic COVID-19,
      clinical outcomes, and asymptomatic infection with the virus causing COVID-19 will be
      recorded during the follow-up period. If they are diagnosed with COVID-19 during the period
      of prophylaxis, they will continue their prophylaxis unless advised to do so by their
      healthcare professional until they run out of their current supply of chloroquine/
      hydroxychloroquine or placebo at home. They will not collect more. They will be followed up
      for 28 days (up until a maximum of 60 days if not recovered at 28 days).

        Study Participants

        These are of two types:

        A. Adult volunteers (exact age is dependent on countries) working as a healthcare worker or
        frontline (i.e. patient contact) in a healthcare facility or similar institution

        B. Provided that they are willing to participate in the trial and can be followed
        adequately for up to 5 months, we may also enrol hospitalised patients or relatives exposed

             environment, OR B. is an inpatient or relative of a patient in a participating
             hospital and likely exposed to COVID-19 infection or another high-risk group

          -  Possesses an internet-enabled smartphone (Android or iOS)

             creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml/min

          -  Already taking chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or 4-aminoquinolines

          -  Taking a concomitant medication (Abiraterone acetate, Agalsidase, Conivaptan,
             Dabrafenib, Dacomitinib, Enzalutamide, Idelalisib, Mifepristone, Mitotane, tiripentol)
             which cannot be safely stopped
