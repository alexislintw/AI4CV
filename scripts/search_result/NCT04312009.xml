  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Respiratory Score</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The SOFA assessment is used to track a person's risk status during stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems. Each organ system is assigned a point value from 0 (normal) to 4 (high degree of dysfunction/failure).
Outcome is reported as only the respiratory component score. Respiratory scores range from 0-4, with higher scores indicating greater chance of mortality due to respiratory failure.</description>

    <measure>Acute Kidney Injury</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome reported as the number of participants in each arm who experience acute kidney injury as defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines:
Increase in serum creatinine by 0.3mg/dL or more within 48 hours OR
Increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times baseline or more within the last 7 days OR
Urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypotension Requiring Vasopressors</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome reported as the number of participants in each arm requiring the use of vasopressors for hypotension.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The SOFA assessment is used to track a person's risk status during stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems. Each organ system is assigned a point value from 0 (normal) to 4 (high degree of dysfunction/failure). Total score is calculated by entering patient data into a SOFA calculator, a widely-available software. Total scores range from 0-24, with higher scores indicating greater chance of mortality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome reported as the number of participants in each arm who fall into each of 7 categories. Lower scores indicate greater condition severity. The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Death; 2) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 6) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities; 7) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Respiratory Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome reported as the number of participants requiring BiPAP OR high flow nasal cannula OR mechanical ventilation OR extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) utilization during in-patient hospital care in each arm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen Saturation / Fractional Inhaled Oxygen (F/S)</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen saturation (percent) is measured by pulse oximeter. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (unitless) is the volumetric fraction of oxygen to other gases in respiratory support. The F/S ratio is unitless.</description>
