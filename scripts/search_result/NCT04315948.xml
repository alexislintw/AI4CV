    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centre, adaptive, randomized, open clinical trial of the safety and
      efficacy of treatments for COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. The study is a
      multi-centre/country trial that will be conducted in various sites in Europe with Inserm as
      sponsor. Adults (≥18 year-old) hospitalized for COVID-19 with SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air OR acute
      respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support will be randomized
      between 4 treatment arms, each to be given in addition to the usual standard of care (SoC) in
      the participating hospital: SoC alone versus SoC + Remdesivir versus SoC +
      Lopinavir/Ritonavir versus SoC + Lopinavir/Ritonavir plus interferon ß-1a versus SoC +
      Hydroxychloroquine. Randomization will be stratified by European region and severity of
      illness at enrollment (moderate disease: patients NOT requiring non-invasive ventilation NOR
      high flow oxygen devices NOR invasive mechanical ventilation NOR ECMO and severe disease:
      patients requiring non-invasive ventilation OR high flow oxygen devices OR invasive
      mechanical ventilation OR ECMO). The interim trial results will be monitored by a Data
      Monitoring Committee, and if at any stage evidence emerges that any one treatment arm is
      definitely inferior then it will be centrally decided that that arm will be discontinued.
      Conversely, if good evidence emerges while the trial is continuing that some other
      treatment(s) should also be being evaluated then it will be centrally decided that one or
      more extra arms will be added while the trial is in progress. The primary objective of the
      study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of different investigational
      therapeutics relative to the control arm in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the primary
      endpoint is the subject clinical status (on a 7-point ordinal scale) at day 15.

      objectives of the study are to evaluate 1) the clinical efficacy of different investigational
      therapeutics through 28 days of follow-up as compared to the control arm as assessed by
      clinical severity (7-point ordinal scale, national early warning score, oxygenation,
      mechanical ventilation), hospitalization, mortality through 28 days of follow-up, in-hospital
      mortality and 90-day mortality 2) the safety of different investigational therapeutics
      through 28 days of follow-up as compared to the control arm as assessed by the cumulative
      incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), the cumulative incidence of Grade 3 and 4 adverse
      events (AEs), the discontinuation or temporary suspension of antiviral drugs (for any
      reason), and the changes in blood white cell count, haemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, blood
      electrolytes, prothrombine time and international normalized ratio (INR), glucose, total
      bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) over time.
