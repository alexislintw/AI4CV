      Study Objectives:

      Primary

        -  To assess the efficacy (survival without organ failure) of three doses of rhu-pGSN to
           hospitalized subjects with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of three doses of rhu-pGSN

      Secondary

        -  To examine individual components of the primary composite endpoint

        -  To assess the relationship of pGSN levels at baseline with clinical outcomes

        -  To assess changes in WHO 9 point severity score

      Immunogenicity

      • To investigate the development of antibodies against pGSN post-treatment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy and safety of intravenous rhu-pGSN on top of standard of care will be evaluated
      initially in 60 participants representative of the drug target population: high-risk subjects
      with acute severe pneumonia due to COVID-19. The rhu-pGSN dose will be based on actual body
      weight given at 12 mg/kg. Three doses will be given at 0, 12 and 24 hours intervals promptly
      after enrollment by IV infusion through a 0.2 µ filter. Participants will be randomized 1:1
      rhu-pGSN or placebo. Interim safety analyses will be conducted after enrollment of 12, 24,
      36, and 48 patients.

      The primary efficacy outcome will be the proportion of patients surviving on Day 14 without
      mechanical ventilation, vasopressors or dialysis. Secondary analyses will examine mortality
      and the composite endpoint at 14, 28 and 90 days. In addition, exploratory analyses will
      involve the number of days up to day 28 without respiratory, vasopressor or renal support
      separately, duration of IV and total antimicrobial therapy, medical costs, and outcomes by
      pathogen type. Baseline and sequential levels of pGSN and inflammatory biomarkers will be
      measured. On days 0, 28, and 90, immunogenicity due to the formation of anti-pGSN antibodies
      will be assessed.
