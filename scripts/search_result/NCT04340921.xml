    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is associated with complications including ARDS and myocardial injury, which informs
      prognosis and patient outcome. The laboratory plans to perform immunophenotyping of
      peripheral T-cells in patients with COVID-19 and complications (ARDS, ITU admission,
      myocardial injury) and map this against clinical patient outcomes. The aim is to determine if
      there is a specific T-cell immunophenotype associated with COVID-19 and/or complications,
      which can be used to inform prognosis and potential therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has now been designated a pandemic
      by the World Health Organisation (WHO). COVID-19 infection can result in a severe pneumonitis
      which, when present, dominates the clinical course for most patients. However, other organs
      may also be directly or indirectly affected and the cardiovascular (CV) system appears to
      have complex interactions with COVID-19. Published reports and personal communications detail
      evidence of acute myocardial injury in 20-40% of hospitalised cases manifesting as cardiac
      chest pain, fulminant heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac death. Indeed, symptoms
      of cardiac chest pain and palpitations are presenting features in some patients.

      In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, cardiac injury is common, correlates with disease severity
      and is likely to reflect a variety of mechanisms. The relative importance of these causes may
      alter during the course of a severe illness and include local and systemic factors resulting
      in myocardial infarction (type 1 or 2), virally-mediated cytolysis and
      immunologically-mediated injury. More than one mechanism may be active at a time: for
      example, troponin elevation is present in up to 80% of (non-COVID) patients hospitalised with
      septic shock in the absence of significant epicardial coronary disease.

      Many of those affected were previously well, but approximately half of those admitted to
      hospitals in Hunan province with COVID-19 had known comorbidities, increasing to about two
      thirds in those requiring ITU admission or those that do not survive. Indeed, patients with
      pre-existing CV conditions (hypertension in particular) seem to have some of the worst
      outcomes. These observations indicate that pre-existing CV disorders may reduce an
      individual's capacity to withstand severe illness. Alternative hypotheses, that commonly used
      treatments for CV disorders (or the diseases themselves) confer increased susceptibility to
      COVID-19 disease are attracting intense speculation5. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
      serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-27. Levels of ACE2 may be affected by ACE-i/ARB
      therapy, which has led to concerns over the use of these drugs during the current COVID-19
      epidemic. At present there is no evidence that ACE2 is increased with RAS blockade in humans
      and animal data is conflicting.

      However, these mechanisms might not play a major role in the patients with no known
      pre-existing conditions (approximately 50%), and additional mechanisms are likely to be
      responsible for the acute myocardial injury detected in 20-40% of cases of hospitalised
      cases6. A question central to potential therapeutic options is the extent to which myocardial
      injury results from viral replication (cytopathic), is immune mediated or is due to other
      mechanisms. Given that rapid deterioration can occur at least a week after symptomatic
      disease (unpublished observations) it is proposed that evaluating the contribution of
      adaptive T-cell mediated immunity and characterising its phenotype is pivotal to
      understanding and targeting inflammation in COVID-19 associated myocardial injury.

      The laboratory have discovered a subset of T-cells in mice and humans that specifically
      migrate to the heart during cardiac inflammation9. Cardiac migration (cardiotropism) is
      determined by expression of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor c-Met, which is
      triggered by the release of HGF by stromal cells in damaged cardiac tissue. HGF is
      transported to local draining lymph nodes where it binds to the receptor c-Met on naïve
      T-cells, inducing c-Met expression and the upregulation of chemokine receptors CCR4 and
      CXCR3. While c-Met expression enables T-cell cardiotropism, CCR4 and CXCR3 sustain selective
      T-cell recruitment to the heart. Importantly, cardiotropic T-cells can be detected in the
      circulation of mice and humans in heart allograft rejection and during acute myocarditis.
      Staining of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) samples from patients with acute myocarditis (AM) has
      shown that cardiotropic (c-Met+) T-cells are present in the inflammatory myocardial
      infiltrate (Pilot data, unpublished).

      Pilot data has shown that it is possible detect a population of cardiotropic memory T-cells
      (CD4/CD8+ c-Met+ CD45RO+) by flow cytometry of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs) purified from a routine blood sample from patients with acute myocarditis. A
      significantly greater proportion of cardiotropic memory T-cells has been detected in patients
      with AM and inflammatory DCM (iDCM) relative to both healthy controls and patients with ST
      elevation myocardial infarction. The laboratory have demonstrated that cardiotropic T-cell
      proliferation in AM is dominantly driven by the cardiac autoantigen myosin heavy chain.
      Cardiotropic T-cells in AM are also more likely to express markers of early activation such
      as CD69+, and produce higher levels of the cytokines IL-4, IL-17A and IL-22, in line with
      previous reports assessing the functional phenotype of T-cells in AM and DCM12. Neutralising
      monoclonal antibodies against two of these cytokines are commercially available and approved
      for use in humans (IL-17A - Ixekizumab and IL-4 - Dupilumab). An increase in the proportion
      of cardiotropic regulatory T-cells has also been observed in AM. The laboratory has also
      developed a mouse model of experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM), which spontaneously
      progresses to DCM and allows monitoring of the presence and functional development of c-Met+
      T cells in the circulation during, and as surrogate marker of disease progression.
      Specifically, mice who develop chronic inflammation and subsequent DCM have been shown to
      maintain high levels of c-Met+ T-cells in the blood, in contrast to mice that recover from
      AM. Early treatment (day 8-18) with the c-Met inhibitor PHA-665752 following immunisation
      with cardiac myosin can attenuate the rise in c-Met+ T-cells and reduce cardiac inflammation.

      04. Original hypothesis

      T-cell mediated autoimmunity is a key pathogenic factor in the development of myocardial
      injury secondary to COVID-19 and that deep immunophenotyping of cardiotropic T-cells in these
      patients will provide specific targets for disease-modifying immunosuppression. The aim is to
      test the following hypotheses:

        1. Patients with myocardial injury secondary to COVID-19 have evidence of cardiac
           autoimmune inflammation reflected by the presence of circulating cardiotropic (c-Met+)
           T-cells. These react to self-cardiac antigens and are functionally defined by a
           pro-inflammatory phenotype.

        2. The presence of cardiotropic T-cells in patients presenting with COVID-19 predicts the
           development of myocardial injury.

        3. The persistence of cardiotropic T-cells following COVID-19 associated myocardial injury
           can be used to inform prognosis and therapy.

They will be followed-up for at least 12 months following discharge and clinical outcomes (death, re-admission, development of heart failure) will be recorded. All patients in group 1 will have their electronic health record reviewed weekly to assess for complications such as myocardial injury and ARDS.
