  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if a brief online-delivered cognitive-behavioral
      intervention can reduce the degree of dysfunctional worry related to the Covid-19 pandemic,
      compared to a wait-list control condition.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worries about the immediate and long-term consequences of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic are
      largely justified in the current climate of uncertainty. However, dysfunctional worry, that
      is, pervasive worry that is disproportionate in its intensity or duration, and that
      significantly interferes with every-day problem-solving or goal-driven behavior, is clearly
      counterproductive. Research has also indicated that repeated media exposure to a community
      crisis can lead to increased anxiety and heightened stress responses, that can give a
      downstream effect on health, and misplaced health-protective and help-seeking behaviors
      which, in turn, may overburden health care facilities. There is an urgent need to develop a
      brief, scalable intervention to target such dysfunctional worry in the general population.

      The current randomized controlled trial will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a brief
      online-delivered cognitive behavioral intervention designed to target dysfunctional worry
      related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 670 individuals are randomized to intervention or to
      waiting-list. The hypothesis is that the brief self-guided intervention will show significant
      within-group reductions in self-rated worry from baseline (week 0) to post-treatment (week
      3), and that these improvements will be larger than those seen in the wait-list control
      group. The wait-list group will be crossed over to receive the intervention after three weeks
      (post-treatment). All participants will be followed-up one month and one year after the end
      of the intervention.

    <description>A three week intervention including a structured self-guided program without therapist support, administered via a secure web platform, focusing on 1) teaching participants how to discriminate between functional- and dysfunctional worry (what are solvable problems vs. what is worry, i.e. unsolvable thoughts?) 2) providing participants with skills to solve functional worry topics (e.g. set time and make a workable plan to be prepared for possible negative outcomes [e.g. becoming unemployed]), 3) providing participants with skills to approach dysfunctional worry (e.g., not engage in worrisome thoughts, just leave them, refrain from excessive use of media coverage about Covid-19), and 4) increase the behavioral repertoire (take walks, engage in activities that promote health without putting yourself at risk to become infected) and provide advice how to properly assess and digest new information about Covid-19 and its consequences.</description>
