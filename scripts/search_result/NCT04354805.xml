      In this study, defined cases of COVID-19 confirmed with PCR, with a mild, moderate or severe
      pneumonia will be treated with chlorpromazine IV injection. The improvement in clinical &amp;
      laboratory manifestations will be evaluated in treated patient compared to control group.

      Background:

      Coronaviruses (CoVs) primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and mammals but, in the
      last few decades, have shown to be capable of infecting humans as well. The viral Covid-19
      outbreak is currently considered a pandemic according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).
      COVID-19 integration to the host cells requires active function of lysosome with a pH value
      from 4 to 5. This is the suitable PH for the bio-chemical reactions thats ends with removal
      of the viral protein envelope and freedom of the viral genetic material for replication.

      Chlorpromazine is an antagonist of the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and has been effectively
      and safely employed for over half a century in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The
      potential efficacy of Chlorpromazine as a treatment for COVID-19 depends on the ability of
      Chlorpromazine to increase the pH of lysosome. This will deprive the COVID-19 to set its
      genetic material free for further replication.

      Aim of the study:

      This study aims to evaluate the effect of administration of the Chlorpromazine on COVID-19
      patients.The improving clinical outcomes and reducing the need for ventilator support will be
      evaluated in treated patient compared to control group. Approximately 60 participants
      hospitalized with COVID-19 in Cairo University hospitals will be enrolled into this study.

      Materials and methods:

        -  Consents are collected from control and study group according to the ethical
           regluations.

        -  Intra-venous administration of Chlorpromazine, a dose of 25 mg every 6 hours for
           duration of 1 week.

        -  Evaluation will be done through monitoring:

             1. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

             2. The lymphocyte count.

             3. C-reactive protein (CRP).

             4. Arterial Blood gases for Patients on Ventilators only.

             5. The change in patients clinical manifestation [ Time Frame: up to 3 weeks ] (Mild,
                Moderate or Severe).

             6. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
