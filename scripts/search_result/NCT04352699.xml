  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The French healthcare system has been strongly mobilized since the start of the Covid-19
      epidemic to take care of patients with Covid-19. This should not overlook the fact that some
      treatments, surgeries and examinations of non-Covid-19 patients must imperatively be
      maintained according to the assessment of their risk-benefit balance. In context, it appears
      that this is not always the case. In addition to the necessary social containment measures,
      there are general limitations on patient access to the operating theater, neglecting the
      individual interest of naive non-Covid-19 patients. Certain studies which report a higher and
      earlier risk of death of undetected and ultimately operated Covid-19 patients has reinforced,
      as a precaution, the massive deprogramming of naive patients and the restrictive access of
      surgical care for all. We believe that this could lead to a risk of delayed treatments and
      renunciation of care for naive patients who should not be considered at risk a priori in the
      event of surgery. The individual clinical and local health context should be first considered
      for appropriate surgical decision-making.

      As such, the French Department of Health and Human Services (DGS) has given general
      guidelines regarding the maintenance of follow-up and care for non-Covid-19 patients in this
      context of containment and major mobilization of health care professionals to care for people
      with COVID. Surgeries which could not be postponed because of the patient's status or if
      their postponement exposed to a significant risk of loss of chance, if needed in the light of
      the recommendations issued by learned societies, were concerned. In this sense, the
      investigator have selected the naive Covid-19 patients from Nice Hospital who should benefit
      from elective or urgent urological surgeries, taking into account their individual risk and
      the territorial epidemic rate. Their rate of ICU stays following their surgery has been
      analysed and their surgical follow-up outcomes during the epidemic period evaluated,
      according to the anti-Covid-19 measures established in Nice Hospital by comparing them to an
      earlier period without Covid-19.
