  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BLD-2660 is a novel, synthetic, orally active, small molecule inhibitor of calpain (CAPN) 1,
      2, and 9 that is selective over the cathepsins as well as other protease families, displays
      good metabolic stability and permeability, oral bioavailability and low cytochrome P450 (CYP)
      inhibition. It is under development for the treatment of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)
      resulting from infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2),
      where there is significant unmet medical need.

    <textblock>
      Calpains are a class of non-lysosomal cysteine proteases involved in diverse cellular
      processes. Several independent publications indicate that specific host cellular proteases
      called dimeric calpains are essential for the replication of multiple RNA viruses including
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-1. In 2004, Barnard and colleagues
      described that the inhibition of calpains 1 and 2 by distinct calpain inhibitors, MDL 28170
      and SJA 6017, resulted in anti-SARS-CoV activity by reducing infectious virus particle
      replication and hence production (Barnard, 2004). This observation was reproduced with MDL
      28170, which showed a &gt;7-log reduction in SARS-CoV replication in cell culture systems
      (Schneider, 2012). The anti-viral activity of the compound was confirmed to be due to
      inhibition of m calpain by utilizing a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach to selectively
      silence expression of this dimeric calpain isoform. This confirmed the specific requirement
      for dimeric m calpain activity during SARS-CoV replication in vitro (Schneider, 2012). MDL
      28170 is a nonclinical tool calpain inhibitor compound with known off-target liabilities that
      has not been evaluated in nonclinical or clinical safety studies.

      It has been shown that the receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry into the cell is
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) (Kuba, 2010). ACE-2 and the dimeric calpains (data on
      file) are co-expressed in respiratory epithelial cells, the site of both viral entry and
      predominant early lung injury in COVID-19.

      In addition to the potential for anti-viral activity by calpain inhibition, nonclinical
      animal bleomycin lung injury models demonstrated that BLD-2660 normalized tissue IL-6 levels,
      a proinflammatory cytokine demonstrated to be elevated in COVID-19 patients and is implicated
      in disease pathogenesis. This pro-inflammatory cytokine has been shown to contribute to lung
      damage during SARS-CoV infection and the virus itself is capable of directly inducing its
      expression (Bozym, 2011; Yoon, 2008). Thus BLD-2660 could potentially reduce both viral
      replication and the nonproductive host-response to infection, both contributors to morbidity
      and mortality in COVID-19.

      BLD2660, has shown greater selectivity for calpain inhibition than MDL 28170, the prototypic
      calpain inhibitor utilized to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV replication. BLD-2660 lacks
      cross-reactivity with other cysteine proteases such as cathepsins. The safety and
      tolerability of BLD-2660 has been demonstrated in the recently completed Phase 1 single
      ascending dose (SAD)/multiple ascending dose (MAD) B-2660-101 study.

      This study will evaluate BLD-2660 as an add-on therapy to standard of care (SOC) in
      hospitalized subjects with recent diagnosis of COVID-19.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Age:

        At least 18 years of age at the time of signing the ICF.

        - Type of Subject and Disease Characteristics:

        Documented or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR test nasopharyngeal swab ≤ 2 days
        before randomization.

        Hospitalized for COVID-19.

        Diagnosed with COVID-19 as defined by having at least 2 of the following signs or symptoms
        within the past 2 days:

        Fever defined as a body temperature of ≥ 38.0 °C oral, or ≥ 38.3 °C rectal, forehead or
        aural (axillary temperatures are not allowable);

        Cough;

        Fatigue;

        Shortness of breath.

        Radiographic evidence (chest x-ray or CT scan) of one the following:

        Ground-glass opacities, or

        Local or bilateral patchy infiltrates, or

        Interstitial pulmonary infiltrates.

        - Sex:

        Male and/or female subjects.

        Contraception use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the
        methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.

        All subjects (male or female) who are of childbearing potential must agree to use highly
        effective contraception during the study. Female subjects and male partners of female
        subjects must continue to use highly effective contraception for 30 days after the last
        dose of study drug. Female subjects should not donate oocytes during this time. Male
        subjects and female partners of male subjects must continue to use highly effective
        contraception for 90 days. Male subjects must agree not to donate sperm during this time.

        Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception
        for the subject.

        Note: Ethinyl estradiol is the primary estrogen used in hormonal contraceptives. The
        progestin component consists of norethindrone, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethindrone
        acetate, ethynodiol diacetate, norgestimate, desogestrel, and drospirenone. As BLD-2660 is
        a weak CYP3A4 inducer, exposure to both the estrogen and progestin components in hormonal
        contraceptives may be decreased, resulting in an increased risk of pregnancy. As such, it
        is recommended that subjects who are on hormonal contraceptives for birth control should
        use an alternate means of contraception (condoms, diaphragms, intrauterine device (IUD),
        other barrier methods, sexual abstinence, etc.) during participation in the study.

        Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening
        within 72 hours prior to first administration of study drug.

        Women not of childbearing potential must be postmenopausal (defined as cessation of regular
        menstrual periods for at least 1 year

        Treatment with anti-IL 6, anti-IL-6 receptor antagonists, or with Janus kinase inhibitors
        (JAKi) in the past 30 days or plans to receive during the study period.

        and may qualify for the study with Sponsor approval.

        Note: Subjects who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may
        participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous
        investigational agent.
