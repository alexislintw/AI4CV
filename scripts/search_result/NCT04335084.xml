          3. Subjects must agree to practice at least one highly effective method of birth control
             for the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Refusal to sign informed consent form

          2. Any previous positive test for COVID-19 by PCR

          3. Symptomatic for COVID-19

          4. Diarrhea

          5. Type I or II diabetes

          6. Atherosclerotic Coronary Artery Disease

          7. Any contraindication for treatment with Plaquenil

          8. Any comorbidities which, in the opinion of the investigator, constitute health risk
             for the subject. These include congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, prior
             malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer, HIV positive, Hepatitis B Surface
