      This is a phase I, open-label, dose ranging clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females,
      18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria.
      This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of
      mRNA-1273 manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc. mRNA-1273 is a novel lipid nanoparticle
      (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized
      spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment will occur at one domestic site. Forty-five
      subjects will be enrolled into one of three cohorts and will receive an intramuscular (IM)
      injection of mRNA-1273 on Days 1 and 29 in the deltoid muscle. Subjects will be followed
      through 12 months post second vaccination (Day 394). The primary objective is to evaluate the
      safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart,
      across 3 dosages in healthy adults.

      This is a phase I, open-label, dose ranging clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females,
      18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria.
      This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of
      mRNA-1273 manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc. mRNA-1273 is a novel lipid nanoparticle
      (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized
      spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment will occur at one domestic site. Forty-five
      subjects will be enrolled into one of three cohorts (25 microgram [mcg], 100 mcg, 250 mcg).
      Subjects will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection (0.5 milliliter [mL]) of mRNA-1273 on
      Days 1 and 29 in the deltoid muscle and will be followed through 12 months post second
      vaccination (Day 394). Follow-up visits will occur 1, 2 and 4 weeks post each vaccination
      (Days 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, and 57), as well as 3, 6 and 12 months post second vaccination (Days
      119, 209 and 394). The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a
      2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart, across 3 dosages in healthy
      adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity as measured by
      Immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA to the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike)
      protein following a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273 at Day 57.
