  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Patients infected with COVID-19 have an unpredictable risk to worsen and die, making it
           difficult to decide who can quarantine at home and who should be monitored for
           respiratory failure as an inpatient. This risk may be related in part to the patient s
           immune response which can be characterized with respect to the B- and T-cell repertoire.
           Determining patterns of immune response which correlate with clinically effective
           immunity may help in determining risk.

        -  Patients receiving a vaccine for COVID-19 are tested for antibody production, but
           ultimately protection from infection and survival are the most important endpoints,
           which will take time. If patients can be checked for a pre-defined favorable pattern of
           immune response, it may significantly speed selection of effective candidate vaccines.

        -  In patients with hematologic malignancies, including patients with hairy cell leukemia
           (HCL) who we have extensive experience treating, we do not know if we should be steering
           away more from treatments which harm B-cell immunity, like rituximab or obinutuzumab, or
           steering away more from treatments which harm T-cell immunity, like purine analogs.
           Characterizing the immune response in COVID-19 patients will quickly answer this
           question.

      Objective:

      - To characterize immune response in patients with current or prior COVID-19 infection

      Eligibility:

        -  Age 18 years or older

        -  Patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection, or normal donors (i.e., those
           individuals without COVID-19)

      Design:

        -  Blood samples will be collected for research to characterize immune response.

        -  In individuals with known current or prior COVID-19, samples will be obtained up to once
           per week, at least once during the acute phase of infection and once soon after
           recovery. In individuals without COVID-19 at the time of enrollment (i.e., 'normal'
           donors), samples will be collected once; in the case of future COVID-19 infection,
           samples may be collected at the same times during/post-infection as an individual with
           COVID-19 at enrollment.

        -  All subjects will be followed for approximately 2 years. An additional blood sample may
           be collected in all subjects at one additional time after the receipt of future
           COVID-19-related vaccination on or off study.

        -  This protocol does not involve treatment. The accrual ceiling is set at 150 subjects

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals who meet one of the following groups:

        - Patients with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, current or
        resolved; or,

        Normal donors. Note: For the purpose of this study, normal donors are those without a known
        current, past, or suspected COVID-19 infection; individuals may have other medical
        comorbidities or conditions.

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Ability of patient or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and the
             willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Individuals with COVID-19

        - Desire of the patient or normal donor not to submit samples, or medical contraindication
        to sending samples.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Normal Donors

        - Immunosuppressive treatments, such as cytotoxic chemotherapy and current rituximab which
        would decrease normal B-cells. Subjects on steroid therapy would be eligible.
