    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity of low dose oral selinexor
      (KPT-330) and to evaluate the clinical recovery, the viral load, length of hospitalization
      and the rate of morbidity and mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to placebo.

    <description>The ViVi or Vienna Vaccine Safety Initiative Disease Severity Score ranges from 0 to 22 with the disease severity indicated by increasing score. It is used to score disease severity and risk in patients with influenza-like illness and/or other forms of acute respiratory infections (e.g. RSV, adenovirus metapneumovirus, rhinovirus and other respiratory viral pathogens), including in infants and children. The Investigator will ask yes/no questions to the patient, and the mobile application will automatically calculate the score.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 by standard approved Reverse transcription
             polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay or equivalent approved testing.

          -  Currently hospitalized and consented within the first 48 hours of hospitalization.

          -  Informed consent provided as above (participants must be dosed with study drug within
             12 hours of consent).

          -  Has symptoms of severe COVID-19 as demonstrated by:

               -  At least one of the following: fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache,
                  muscle pain, shortness of breath at rest or with exertion, confusion, or symptoms
                  of severe lower respiratory symptoms including dyspnea at rest or respiratory
                  distress.

        AND

        • Clinical signs indicative of lower respiratory infection with COVID-19, with at least one
        of the following: respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/minute (min), heart rate ≥ 125 /min, Oxygen
        saturation (SaO2) &lt; 93% on room air or requires &gt; 2 Liter (L)/minute oxygen by NC in order
        maintain SaO2 ≥ 93%, PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 300 mm/hg.

             hydroxychloroquine) are permitted.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             Screening. Female patients of childbearing potential and fertile male patients who are
             sexually active with a female of childbearing potential must use highly effective
             methods of contraception throughout the study and for 3 months following the last dose

                  ventilation, oxygen delivered by high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive positive
                  pressure ventilation, or clinical diagnosis of respiratory failure in setting of
                  resource limitations)

               -  Septic shock (defined by Systolic blood pressure [BP] &lt; 90 millimeter of mercury
                  [mm Hg], or Diastolic BP &lt; 60 mm Hg)

               -  Multiple organ dysfunction/failure

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to survive for at least 48 hours from
             screening or anticipate mechanical ventilation within 48 hours.

          -  Inadequate hematologic parameters as indicated by the following labs:

               -  Participants with severe neutropenia (ANC &lt;1,000 x 109/L) or

               -  Thrombocytopenia (e.g., platelets &lt;100,000 per microliter of blood)

          -  Inadequate renal function as indicated by creatinine clearance (CrCL) &lt;20 milliliter
             per minute (mL/min) using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault.

          -  Inadequate hepatic function defined as Aspartate transaminase (AST) or Alanine
             transaminase (ALT) &gt; 2.5x the upper limit of normal OR serum direct bilirubin &gt; 1.5x
             the upper limit of normal.

          -  Unable to take oral medication when informed consent is obtained.

          -  Participants with a legal guardian or who are incarcerated.
