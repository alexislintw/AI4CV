          2. Age >=18 years, regardless of gender;

          3. Subjects with pneumonia diagnosed as 2019-nCoV infection; A) Detection of 2019-nCoV
             nucleic acid positive by RT-PCR in respiratory tract or blood samples.

             B) The virus gene sequence of respiratory tract or blood samples is highly homologous
             to the known 2019-nCoV.

          4. According to the standard of "pneumonia diagnosis and treatment Program of New
             Coronavirus infection (trial Fifth Edition)" issued by National Health Commission of
             the People's Republic of China, clinical classification: mild, ordinary subjects; A)
             Mild type, the clinical symptoms were mild and no pneumonia was found in imaging.

        B) Common type, With fever, respiratory tract and other symptoms, the manifestations of
        pneumonia can be seen on imaging.

          1. Critical type:

             If one of the following conditions is met:

             A) Respiratory failure occurs and mechanical ventilation is needed; B) Shock occurred;
             C) Patients with other organ failure need ICU monitoring treatment.

          2. Severe type:

             If one of the following conditions is met:

             A) Respiratory distress, RR >= 30 beats / min; B) In resting state, finger oxygen
             saturation (SaO2) <= 93%; C) Partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) / concentration
             of oxygen inhaled (FiO2)<=300mmHg

             B) abnormal liver function is defined as:

             i) level of total bilirubin(TBil) : 2 times Upper Limits of Normal(ULN); ii) the
             levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine transaminase (ALT)3 times of
             ULN.

             C) definition of renal dysfunction:

             Serum creatinine1.5 times of ULN, or calculated creatinine clearance50ml / min;

             D) definition of abnormal blood coagulation:

             International normalized ratio(INR) 1.5 times of ULN, and the prothrombin time ((PT))
             or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 times of ULN, unless the
             subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy.
