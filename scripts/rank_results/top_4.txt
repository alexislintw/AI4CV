        - Age:

        At least 18 years of age at the time of signing the ICF.

        - Type of Subject and Disease Characteristics:

        Documented or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR test nasopharyngeal swab <= 2 days
        before randomization.

        Hospitalized for COVID-19.

        Diagnosed with COVID-19 as defined by having at least 2 of the following signs or symptoms
        within the past 2 days:

        Fever defined as a body temperature of >= 38.0 *C oral, or >= 38.3 *C rectal, forehead or
        aural (axillary temperatures are not allowable);

        Cough;

        Fatigue;

        Shortness of breath.

        Radiographic evidence (chest x-ray or CT scan) of one the following:

        Ground-glass opacities, or

        Local or bilateral patchy infiltrates, or

        Interstitial pulmonary infiltrates.

        - Sex:

        Male and/or female subjects.

        Contraception use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the
        methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.

        All subjects (male or female) who are of childbearing potential must agree to use highly
        effective contraception during the study. Female subjects and male partners of female
        subjects must continue to use highly effective contraception for 30 days after the last
        dose of study drug. Female subjects should not donate oocytes during this time. Male
        subjects and female partners of male subjects must continue to use highly effective
        contraception for 90 days. Male subjects must agree not to donate sperm during this time.

        Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception
        for the subject.

        Note: Ethinyl estradiol is the primary estrogen used in hormonal contraceptives. The
        progestin component consists of norethindrone, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethindrone
        acetate, ethynodiol diacetate, norgestimate, desogestrel, and drospirenone. As BLD-2660 is
        a weak CYP3A4 inducer, exposure to both the estrogen and progestin components in hormonal
        contraceptives may be decreased, resulting in an increased risk of pregnancy. As such, it
        is recommended that subjects who are on hormonal contraceptives for birth control should
        use an alternate means of contraception (condoms, diaphragms, intrauterine device (IUD),
        other barrier methods, sexual abstinence, etc.) during participation in the study.

        Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening
        within 72 hours prior to first administration of study drug.

        Women not of childbearing potential must be postmenopausal (defined as cessation of regular
        menstrual periods for at least 1 year

        - Informed Consent:

        Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements
        and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this protocol

        
---


        - Medical Conditions:

        Active bacterial pneumonia infection

        Known active tuberculosis (TB).

        Known history of testing positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2
        antibodies).

        Known active Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or known
        active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected) infection.

        Note: No testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local
        health authority

        History of Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis.

        History of acute coronary syndrome requiring hospital admission or symptomatic ischemic
        heart disease within 24 weeks prior to screening.

        Subjects requiring high flow oxygen defined as >50 L/min.

        It is not in the best interest of the subjects to participate, in the opinion of the
        treating Investigator.

        Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive within the
        projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 90 days after
        the last dose of study drug.

        - Diagnostic Assessments:

        The following laboratory parameters are excluded:

        Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >5 x upper limit of
        normal (ULN);

        Creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min.

        - Prior Therapy:

        Requiring, or expected to require mechanical ventilation at screening.

        Concurrent treatment with other agents with actual or possible direct acting antiviral
        activity against SARS-CoV-2 within 24 hours prior to initiation of study drug dosing (e.g.
        remdesivir within 6 half-lives).

        Treatment with anti-IL 6, anti-IL-6 receptor antagonists, or with Janus kinase inhibitors
        (JAKi) in the past 30 days or plans to receive during the study period.

        - Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience:

        Participation in any other clinical study of an experimental drug treatment for COVID-19
        within 6 half-lives of the experimental treatment.

        Current participation or have participated in a study of an investigational agent or has
        used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.

        Note: Subjects participating in an observational study are an exception to this criterion
        and may qualify for the study with Sponsor approval.

        Note: Subjects who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may
        participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous
        investigational agent.

        - Other Exclusions:

        Unable to swallow solid oral medication or known malabsorption disorder.

        Subjects who have allergy to BLD-2660 or inactive components of BLD-2660.
