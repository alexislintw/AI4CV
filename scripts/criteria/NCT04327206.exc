          -  Has any BCG vaccine contraindication

          -  Fever or generalised skin infection (where feasible, randomisation can be delayed
             until cleared)

          -  Weakened resistance toward infections due to a disease in/of the immune system

          -  Receiving medical treatment that affects the immune response or other
             immunosuppressive therapy in the last year. These therapies include systemic
             corticosteroids (more than or equal to 20 mg for more than or equal to 2 weeks),
             non-biological immunosuppressant (also known as 'DMARDS'), biological agents (such as
             monoclonal antibodies against tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha).

          -  Has a congenital cellular immunodeficiency, including specific deficiencies of the
             interferon-gamma pathway

          -  Has a malignancy involving bone marrow or lymphoid systems

          -  Has any serious underlying illness (such as malignancy). Please note: People with
             cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and/or chronic respiratory disease are
             eligible if not immunocompromised

          -  Known or suspected HIV infection, even if asymptomatic or has normal immune function.
             This is because of the risk of disseminated BCG infection

          -  Has active skin disease such as eczema, dermatitis or psoriasis at or near the site of
             vaccination. A different site (other than left arm) can be chosen if necessary

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding Although there is no evidence that BCG vaccination is
             harmful during pregnancy or breastfeeding, it is a contra-indication to BCG
             vaccination. Therefore, we will exclude women who think they could be pregnant.

          -  Another live vaccine administered in the month prior to randomisation

          -  Require another live vaccine to be administered within the month following BCG
             randomisation If the other live vaccine can be given on the same day, this exclusion
             criteria does not apply

          -  Known anaphylactic reaction to any of the ingredient present in the BCG vaccine

          -  BCG vaccine given within the last year

          -  Has previously had a SARS-CoV-2 positive test result

          -  Already part of this trial, recruited at a different hospital
