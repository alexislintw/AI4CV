        It is not in the best interest of the subjects to participate, in the opinion of the
        treating Investigator.

        Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive within the
        projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 90 days after
        the last dose of study drug.

        - Diagnostic Assessments:

        The following laboratory parameters are excluded:

        Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >5 x upper limit of
        normal (ULN);

        Creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min.

        - Prior Therapy:

        Requiring, or expected to require mechanical ventilation at screening.

        Concurrent treatment with other agents with actual or possible direct acting antiviral
        activity against SARS-CoV-2 within 24 hours prior to initiation of study drug dosing (e.g.
        remdesivir within 6 half-lives).

        Treatment with anti-IL 6, anti-IL-6 receptor antagonists, or with Janus kinase inhibitors
        (JAKi) in the past 30 days or plans to receive during the study period.

        - Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience:

        Current participation or have participated in a study of an investigational agent or has
        used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.

        Note: Subjects participating in an observational study are an exception to this criterion
        and may qualify for the study with Sponsor approval.

        Note: Subjects who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may
        participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous
        investigational agent.

        - Other Exclusions:

        Unable to swallow solid oral medication or known malabsorption disorder.

        Subjects who have allergy to BLD-2660 or inactive components of BLD-2660.
