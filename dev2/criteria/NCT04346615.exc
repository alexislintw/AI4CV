          1. Subjects in immediate need of mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane
             oxygenation (ECMO)

          2. Subjects with an estimated creatinine clearance of < 60 mL/min, at the Screening Visit

          3. Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated

          4. Subjects who are participating in any other investigational clinical trial while
             participating in this clinical trial

          5. Subjects who are under the age of 18 years

          6. Subjects who are pregnant (all potential female enrollees need to have a negative
             pregnancy test prior to IP administration)

          7. Subjects with multi-organ failure

          8. Subjects who have received more than 24 hours of supplemental oxygen prior to
             randomization

          9. Subjects with prior significant pulmonary disease (e.g., COPD/ILD/CHF/IPF) are
             excluded

         10. Subjects receiving investigational therapies as part of a formal clinical trial for
             the treatment of COVID-19. During the course of this study, investigational therapies
             that may become "standard of care" to treat COVID-19, but are not part of a clinical
             trial, are allowed

         11. Subjects who are on long-acting CGRP monoclonal antibodies will be excluded including
             Aimovig (erenumab), Emgality (galcanezumab), Ajovy (fremanezumab), and Vyepti
             (eptinezumab). Additionally, the investigational oral CGRP receptor antagonist,
             atogepant, that is taken daily will also be excluded. Oral CGRP receptor antagonists,
             Nurtec ODT (rimegepant) and Ubelvy (ubrogepant) that are typically used PRN
             infrequently will not be excluded as long the subject was not taking them on a daily
             basis and does not take them during the current study

         12. Subjects who are unlikely to survive for more than 48 hours from the Screening Visit

         13. Subjects with any of the following abnormal laboratory values at screening: aspartate
             AST or ALT greater than 3x ULN or bilirubin greater than 2x ULN

         14. Subjects with known active TB, history of incompletely treated TB, suspected or known
             extrapulmonary TB

         15. Subjects with suspected or known systemic bacterial or fungal infections. However,
             empiric antibiotics are permitted.

         16. Subjects who have participated in any clinical research study evaluating an IP or
             therapy within 3 months and less than 5 half-lives of IP prior to the screening visit

         17. Subjects with any physical examination findings and/or history of any illness that, in
             the opinion of the study investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose
             an additional risk to the subject by their participation in the study
