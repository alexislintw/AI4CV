  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytokines and chemokines are thought to play an important role in immunity and
      immunopathology during virus infections [3]. Patients with severe COVID-19 have higher serum
      levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8) compared to
      individuals with mild disease or healthy controls, similar to patients with SARS or MERS .
      The change of laboratory parameters, including elevated serum cytokine, chemokine levels, and
      increased NLR in infected patients are correlated with the severity of the disease and
      adverse outcome, suggesting a possible role for hyper-inflammatory responses in COVID-19
      pathogenesis. Importantly, previous studies showed that viroporin E, a component of
      SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), forms Ca2C-permeable ion channels and activates the
      NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, another viroporin 3a was found to induce NLRP3 inflammasome
      activation . The mechanisms are unclear.

      Colchicine, an old drug used in auto-inflammatory disorders (i.e., Familiar Mediterranean
      Fever and Bechet disease) and in gout, counteracts the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
      thereby reducing the release of IL-1b and an array of other interleukins, including IL-6,
      that are formed in response to danger signals. Recently, colchicine has been successfully
      used in two cases of life-threatening post-transplant capillary leak syndrome. These patients
      had required mechanically ventilation for weeks and hemodialysis, before receiving
      colchicine, which abruptly restored normal respiratory function and diuresis over 48 hrs [4].
