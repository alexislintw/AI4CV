      Primary Objectives:

      Phase 2: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of sarilumab relative to the control arm in adult
      patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 Phase 3: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of
      sarilumab relative to the control arm in adult patients hospitalized with severe or critical
      COVID-19

      Secondary Objectives:

      Phase 2 and Phase 3

        -  Evaluate the clinical efficacy of sarilumab compared to the control arm by clinical
           severity

        -  Evaluate changes in the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2)

        -  Evaluate the duration of predefined symptoms and signs (if applicable)

        -  Evaluate the duration of supplemental oxygen dependency (if applicable)

        -  Evaluate the incidence of new mechanical ventilation use during the study

        -  Evaluate the duration of new mechanical ventilation use during the Study

        -  Evaluate the proportion of patients requiring rescue medication during the 28-day period

        -  Evaluate need for admission into intensive care unit (ICU)

        -  Evaluate duration of hospitalization (days)

        -  Evaluate the 28-day mortality rate

        -  The secondary safety objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of sarilumab
           through hospitalization (up to day 29 if patient is still hospitalized) compared to the
           control arm as assessed by incidence of:

             -  Serious adverse events (SAEs)

             -  Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC&lt;500/mmˆ3) with concurrent severe or life-threatening
                bacterial, invasive fungal, or opportunistic infection

             -  Grade ≥2 infusion related reactions

             -  Grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions

             -  Increase in alanine transaminase (ALT) ≥3X upper limit of normal (ULN) (for
                patients with normal baseline) or &gt;3X ULN AND at least 2-fold increase from
                baseline value (for patients with abnormal baseline)

             -  Invasive bacterial or fungal infections of clinical significance with confirmed
                diagnosis based on the investigator's assessment with appropriate diagnostic
                workups and consultations
