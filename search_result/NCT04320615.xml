      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of
      tocilizumab (TCZ) compared with a matching placebo in combination with standard of care (SOC)
      in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed per WHO criteria (including a positive
             PCR of any specimen; e.g., respiratory, blood, urine, stool, other bodily fluid) and
             evidenced by chest X-ray or CT scan

          -  SPO2 &lt;/=93% or PaO2/FiO2 &lt;300 mmHg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known severe allergic reactions to TCZ or other monoclonal antibodies

          -  Active tuberculosis (TB) infection

          -  Suspected active bacterial, fungal, viral, or other infection (besides COVID-19)

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, progression to death is imminent and inevitable
             within the next 24 hours, irrespective of the provision of treatments

          -  Have received oral anti-rejection or immunomodulatory drugs (including TCZ) with the
             past 6 months

          -  Participating in other drug clinical trials (participation in COVID-19 anti-viral
             trials may be permitted if approved by Medical Monitor)

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding, or positive pregnancy test in a pre-dose examination

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 5 half-lives or 30 days (whichever is
             longer) of randomization (investigational COVID-19 antivirals may be permitted if
             approved by Medial Monitor)

          -  Any serious medical condition or abnormality of clinical laboratory tests that, in the
             investigator's judgment, precludes the patient's safe participation in and completion
             of the study

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 10 x upper limit
             of normal (ULN) detected within 24 hours at screening or at baseline (per local lab)

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1000/mL at screening and baseline (per local lab)

          -  Platelet count &lt; 50,000/mL at screening and baseline (per local lab)
