  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Albertans with COVID-19 are at risk of deteriorating and developing severe illness. Those
      over age 40 and those with comorbid illness, including those with immunosuppressed states may
      be at highest risk.

      Participants will be informed of the study by public health when they are tested for
      COVID-19. The study description and consent form will also be posted on the Alberta Covid-19
      website for all Albertans to be aware of. Patients being tested for COVID-19 according to the
      guidance developed by Alberta Public Health will be referred to this website and those who
      indicate they do not have access to this information will be provided with written
      information at the time of testing.

      Participants will be informed that they are potentially eligible for the study when a
      positive COVID-19 test is confirmed. They will be asked by public health for consent to be
      contacted by a study coordinator and their email address and phone number will be obtained.
      These will then be shared with the investigators. Potential participants will be reminded to
      review the study information and informed consent form on the website if possible.

      The investigators will then initiate contact with potential participants by email (preferred)
      or telephone. The study requirements will be reviewed, and the potential participant will
      have an opportunity to ask questions. Consent for participation will preferably be obtained
      electronically; those without internet access may provide consent by telephone.

      Participants will then be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria by electronic
      questionnaire or telephone interview and Alberta Netcare medical record review. Follow-up
      questions to confirm eligibility by email or telephone may be required.

      Those who are eligible will be randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine or placebo for a
      total duration of 5 days. Those who are not eligible will be informed and the reasons for
      ineligibility will be explained why (generally it will be a safety exclusion and they should
      be aware). Study drug will be delivered to their residence by courier.

      Outcomes will be collected by electronic questionnaire, administrative data and review of
      Alberta Netcare. If follow-up questionnaires are not completed within 24 hours telephone
      follow-up will be attempted. Those completing the study who do not have internet access will
      be followed by telephone. Administrative data, and information on Alberta Netcare will also
      be used for follow-up. The duration of the followup is 30 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial will determine if
      hydroxychloroquine for 5 days, initiated within 72 hours of a confirmed diagnosis of
      COVID-19, reduces the occurrence of severe COVID-19 disease. Severe disease is defined as the
      composite of mechanical ventilation or death at 30 days. This trial will enrol consenting
      Albertans who are not hospitalized, are over age 40, have no contraindication to treatment
      with hydroxychloroquine, who do not have a severe underlying comorbidity where treatment is
      not likely to be beneficial to the patient.

      Secondary outcomes will be the proportion requiring invasive mechanical ventilation,
      diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), use of vasopressors, receipt of
      ECMO/ECLS, diagnosis of median length of stay, in-hospital and 30-day mortality, EQ5D at 30
      days, disposition at 30 days.

      Randomization will be stratified by risk of severe disease. A pre-specified risk tool that
      includes classification by immunosuppression status will define patient strata.

      Alberta has a single publicly funded health care system with processes and administrative
      data that will allow complete capture of health system encounters and resource utilization.
      The population is ethnically diverse (ref) and most Albertans have internet access to allow
      electronic enrolment and data capture.

      The current COVID-19 epidemic has also paused most ongoing research, thus providing access to
      a large number of experienced researchers and highly trained research staff.

      Lack of any proven treatments for this severe condition makes it imperative that we use the
      resources we have to try to improve the lives of Albertans and determine if there is evidence
      for the use of hydroxychloroquine for confirmed COVID-19 disease, overall, and in high risk
      participants.

It is predicted that patients will want treatment. Further, immunosuppressed patients may be at the highest risk of fatal outcomes. Therefore, we will use 2:1 randomization (hydroxychloroquine: placebo), stratified by risk status (which includes immune status).
Randomization will use a stratified minimal sufficient balance algorithm to ensure balance on age, provincial zone/geographic location</intervention_model_description>
