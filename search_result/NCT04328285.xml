  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, the emergence of a new coronavirus named SARS-Cov-2 in the city of Wuhan
      in China has been responsible for a major epidemic of respiratory infections, including
      severe pneumonia. Within weeks, COVID-19 became a pandemic.

      In the absence of specific antiviral treatment, a special attention should be given to
      prevention. Personal protection equipments may be insufficiently protective, including in
      healthcare workers, a significant proportion of whom (around 4%) having been infected in the
      outbreaks described in China and more recently in Italy. Infection in healthcare workers
      could result from the contact with COVID-19 people in community or with infected colleagues
      or patients.

      As it will take at least a year before vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 becomes available,
      chemoprophylaxis is an option that should be considered in this setting where prevention of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in Health Care Workers.

      The COVIDAXIS trial evaluates a chemoprophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Health Care
      Workers. This trial is divided into two distinct studies that could start independently each
      with its own randomization process: COVIDAXIS 1 will study Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) versus
      placebo; COVIDAXIS 2 will study Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) versus placebo.

      Upon randomization healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in the management of suspected or
      confirmed COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment groups:

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study COVIDAXIS 1( Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) versus placebo) will be realized on 600
      participants and will be implemented first in as many centers as possible.

      Upon randomization healthcare workers involved in the management of suspected or confirmed
      COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment groups:

        -  Group 1.1: HCQ 400 mg, 2 tablets twice daily at Day 1 and 200 mg, 1 tablet once daily
           afterwards

        -  Group 1.2: Placebo of HCQ, 2 tablets twice daily at Day 1 and 1 tablet once daily
           afterwards).

      COVIDAXIS 1

      The COVIDAXIS 2 (Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) versus placebo will be realized on 600
      participants and will be implemented in already participating and newer centers in a second
      step (when LPV/r becomes available).

      Upon randomization healthcare workers involved in the management of suspected or confirmed
      COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment groups:

        -  Group 2.1: LPV/r 400/100 mg, 2 tablets twice daily

        -  Group 2.2: Placebo of LPV/r, 2 tablets twice daily

      Participants will receive the randomized treatment for 2 months and will be followed upon a
      2.5 months period.
