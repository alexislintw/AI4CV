  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that respiratory virus outbreaks and pandemics, such as influenza,
      SARS, MERS, and now the newly emerged SARS-COV2 virus, have a major impact on morbidity and
      mortality worldwide, as well as having devastating global economic and societal impact.
      During these outbreaks it is critical to gain a rapid understanding of the exposures and
      immunity in the general population. Identifying exposures can be accomplished through
      analysis of serum during an outbreak to identify those with specific antibodies to the
      pathogen. The knowledge of the level of exposures could greatly impact the response to
      current and future pandemics. In this natural history study, we will collect a single blood
      draw from individuals to identify individuals who have anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies present
      despite no confirmed disease or known exposures.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. &gt;= 18 years of age.

               2. Willing and able to complete a verbal telephone consent.

               3. Willing to undergo one blood draw or home blood sampling.

               4. Willing to have blood samples stored for future research.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Confirmed history of COVID19 infection or exposure

          2. Current symptoms consistent with COVID19 infection

          3. Any condition or event that, in the PI s opinion, may substantially increase the risk
             associated with study participation or compromise the study s scientific objectives.
             Conditions that exclude a subject are considered to be unlikely, but an example would
             include having an acute respiratory infection or recent exposure that would prevent
             participants that would make it unsafe to obtain blood samples.

          4. Not willing to have blood samples stored for future research.
