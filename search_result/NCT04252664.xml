  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of
      pneumonia of unknown cause. In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome
      information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a
      real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay.

      Given no specific antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV infection and the availability of remdesvir
      as a potential antiviral agent based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
      infections, this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild or moderate 2019-nCoV respiratory
      disease.

    <textblock>
      In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of
      pneumonia of unknown cause. In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome
      information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a
      real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay.

      Whilst the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated
      with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that
      person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The number of cases of infection with
      2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with
      cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally. Mathematical
      models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained person-to-person
      transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the level required for a
      self-sustaining epidemic in human populations.

      The clinical spectrum of 2019-nCoV infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic
      infection, a mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with
      respiratory failure and even death. Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains
      to be determined, and may differ from the initial reports of 10-15%, the large number of
      cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia.
      Progression from prodromal symptoms (usually fever, fatigue, cough) to severe pneumonia
      requiring supplementary oxygen support, mechanical ventilation, or in some cases ECMO appears
      to occur most commonly during the second week of illness in association with persistent viral
      RNA detection. This provides a window of opportunity to test candidate antiviral
      therapeutics.

      This new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for
      therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, reduce risk
      of disease progression, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive
      care and prolonged hospitalisation. In addition, treatments for mild cases to reduce the
      duration of illness and infectivity may also be of value were 2019-nCoV to become pandemic
      and/or endemic in human populations.

      Given no specific antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV infection and the availability of remdesvir
      as a potential antiviral agent based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
      infections, this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild or moderate 2019-nCoV respiratory
      disease.
