  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new human coronavirus that is transmitted through respiratory droplets, SARS-CoV-2, emerged
      in China in December 2019 and has spread rapidly. COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus,
      has a very polymorphous clinical presentation, which ranges from isolated attacks on the
      upper respiratory tract to acute respiratory distress syndrome. It may appear serious
      straightaway or may develop in two stages, with a worsening condition 7 to 10 days after the
      initial clinical signs, potentially linked to a cytokine storm in the immune system and
      accompanied by a high risk of thrombosis. The global mortality rate of COVID-19 is understood
      to be between 3% and 4%, with the more severe forms being more frequent among older age
      groups. Treatment is largely symptomatic as no antiviral treatment to date has shown to be of
      clinical benefit to this illness. Hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine, which is
      commonly used to treat some autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It is
      active in vitro in cell models of infection by multiple viruses, such as HIV, hepatitis C and
      SARS-CoV. However, its use in viral infections among humans has not been demonstrated.

      Very recently, a non-controlled preliminary study looked into the effectiveness of
      hydroxychloroquine on the viral excretion of subjects affected by COVID-19. Among 20 patients
      treated with hydroxychloroquine in doses of 600 mg per day, the percentage of viral findings
      of positive SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharynx using RT-PCR went from 100% on inclusion (start of
      treatment) to 43% six days later. In comparison, among the 16 patients who were not treated,
      90% had a positive RT-PCR six days after inclusion. Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine has
      immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties, which could theoretically prevent or limit
      secondary complications.

      The research hypothesis is that treatment with hydroxychloroquine improves prognosis and
      reduces the risk of death or using an invasive artificial ventilator on patients suffering
      from COVID-19.
