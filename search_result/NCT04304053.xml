  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy of the 'test and treat' strategy of infected
      patients and prophylactic chloroquine treatment to all contacts. The strategy entails
      decentralized COVID-19 testing and starting antiviral darunavir/cobicistat plus chloroquine
      treatment immediately in all who are found to be infected. As viral loads decline to
      undetectable levels, the probability of onward transmission is reduced to very low levels.
      Such evaluation will require prospective surveillance to assess the population-level effect
      of transmission prevention.

      Drug interventions in this protocol will follow the Spanish law about off-label use of
      medicines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research on influenza has indicated that antiviral drugs administered before o short
      after symptom onset can reduce infectiousness to others by reducing viral loads in the
      respiratory secretions of patients.

      Lopinavir/ritonavir, a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV/AIDS, was found to block COVID-19
      infection in vitro at low-micromolar concentration, with a half-maximal effective
      concentration (EC50) of 8.5 μM. China's guidelines were set up in January 2020 and treated
      hospitalized patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, either alone or with various combinations.
      Darunavir (DRV)/Cobicistat, is also a protease inhibitor used to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS.
      Its as effective as lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and better tolerated
      because the adverse effects rate is lower (diarrhea 2% vs 27%).

      Another promising drug is chloroquine, that showed excellent in vitro results and strong
      antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. Results from n=100 patients have
      shown superiority to the control treatment in improving lung imaging findings, promoting
      virus reversion to negative and shortening the disease.
