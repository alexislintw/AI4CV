  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will collect data from patients treated under a compassionate use
      programme with siltuximab (SYLVANT); patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection who have
      developed serious respiratory complications.

      This observational study will group the patients into two cohorts receiving siltuximab.
      Patients in Cohort A are treated in a non-ICU setting and patients in Cohort B are in an ICU
      setting.

      Each patient will have a matched control receiving standard treatment without siltuximab

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center observational case control study in Italy that follows the use of
      treatment with siltuximab in patients with COVID-19 who have developed serious respiratory
      complications. Retrospective data collection will be carried out on those patients who have
      received the drug through the compassionate use program.

      Patients receiving siltuximab that will be included into this observational study will be
      divided into 2 cohorts, and per current estimation split in a 3:1 ratio: 75% will be in
      Cohort A as not treated in an ICU setting and are not on mechanical ventilation, while 25%
      will form Cohort B and consists of patients in an ICU setting who are receiving invasive
      ventilation.

      Each patient will be matched to a consented control patient receiving treatment other than
      siltuximab for their condition.

      Match Criteria

      Patients and controls will be matched according to the following criteria:

        -  Age (by decades)

        -  Sex (M/F)

        -  P/F fraction (&lt;100, 100-150 or &gt;150) at baseline

        -  Antiviral therapy Procedures outlined in this protocol are based on the compassionate
           use program, where patients are managed as per clinicians' best judgement and best
           practice. No clinical procedures are required by this observational protocol. Data on
           the procedures already performed during the routine diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19
           patients will be collected. The list of clinical and laboratory parameters is provided
           to direct data collection for this observational study (as available in the medical
           records).

      During their hospitalization, patients will be monitored as per standard hospital practice or
      as per national (emergency) guidelines in accordance with extraordinary circumstances
      relating to the COVID-19 outbreak. After discharge, patients will be asked to provide (from
      their primary health care providers) relevant laboratory results for 30 days following start
      of COVID-19 treatment via ventilation (either mechanical or non-invasive).
