  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 caused clusters of severe respiratory illness and was associated with 2% mortality.
      No specific anti-viral treatment exists. The mainstay of clinical management is largely
      symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care for seriously ill patients.
      Cellular therapy, using mesenchymal stem cells has been shown to reduce nonproductive
      inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS.
      This clinical trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
      therapy for severe COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (causing the disease Covid-19) has expanded from Wuhan
      throughout China and is being exported to a growing number of countries, some of which have
      seen onward transmission. COVID-19 caused clusters of severe respiratory illness and was
      associated with 2% mortality. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral
      treatment recommended for COVID-19. About 20% of the patients were severe and the mainstay of
      clinical management is largely symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care
      for seriously ill patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic
      approach to COVID-19.

      In the last years, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their
      regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have
      generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on
      cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the
      beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and
      regenerative potential of these cells. MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological
      changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by
      influenza virus in animal model . MSCs has been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation
      and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS. Our phase I
      preliminary data of parallel assignment study(NCT04252118) showed that three doses of MSCs
      was safe in patients with COVID-19. Randomized control trial are needed to assess efficacy
      and safety.

      The investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to
      assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 90 severe
      COVID-19 patients will be recruited in China. 60 patients receive i.v. transfusion 3 times of
      MSCs（ 4.0*10E7 cells per time), as the treated group, all of them receive the conventional
      treatment. In addition, the 30 patients receive placebo and conventional treatment were used
      as control.

      Size of lesion area and severity of pulmonary fibrosis by chest CT, proportion of patients in
      each classification of clinical critical treatment index, oxygen saturation, oxygenation
      index, duration of oxygen therapy, side effects, immunological characteristics (immune cells,
      inflammatory factors, etc.) will be evaluated during the 90 days follow up.
