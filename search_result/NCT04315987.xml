      This is an exploratory study to assess the efficacy of NestCell® (mesenchymal stem cell) to
      treat severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of infections of COVID-19 worldwide has killed thousands and is continually
      rising. The novel coronavirus attacks the human body by attaching to the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a protective enzyme against lung damage. In addition,
      the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for HCoV-19 Spike protein priming is also essential for
      the host cell entry and spread. Coronaviruses can be deadly, in large part because they cause
      &quot;cytokine storms.&quot; These storms result from imbalances between pro-inflammatory and
      anti-inflammatory proteins called cytokines, which can cause extreme inflammation and
      respiratory complications. Respiratory distress kills hundreds of thousands of people each
      year worldwide, and hundreds of clinical trials are testing drugs to treat it.

      MSCs have been widely used in cell-based therapy, from basic research to clinical trials
      Safety and effectiveness have been clearly documented in many clinical trials, especially in
      the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

      NestCell® is a mesenchymal stem cell therapy produced by Cellavita and proved to be safe in
      previous clinical trials.

      The aim of this study is assess the efficacy of NestCell® as an add-on therapy to standard
      treatment to treat patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients will receive 1x10^6
      cells/kg weight on days 1, 3 and 7.

      The study will be divided in 2 phases. In the first phase, 6 patients will be included and
      receive 1x10^6 cells/kg weight on days 1, 3 and 7 in addition to standard care. Thereafter,
      the Safety Monitoring Board will meet and evaluate all collected safety and efficacy
      information and decide whether it is safe to continue the treatment and if the next dose
      should remain the same or if any change in posology or dose should be done. Then, 18 new
      subjects will be included in the study and treated according to Safety Monitoring Board
      recommendation.
