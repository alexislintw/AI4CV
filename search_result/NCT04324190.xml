  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic leads to a greatly increased risk of substantial psychological stress
      worldwide. We intend to evaluate an online support program aiming at reducing stress in the
      context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program consists of twelve modules that participants
      undergo, covering a broad range of topics related to stress in the context of the COVID-19
      pandemic. It has been developed together with and is provided by Selfapy GmbH, Berlin. The
      aim of this randomised clinical trial with observational components is to estimate the
      effects of the intervention as a whole, as well as individual modules and selected chapters.
      Further, follow-up assessments as well as information on risks and the long-term course of
      COVID pandemic-related stress may help to elucidate COVID-19 pandemic stress across time and
      what we can do to prevent long-term negative consequences.

    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this randomised trial with observational component is to estimate the
      effects of a guided digital online support program to increase mental health and reduce
      psychosocial stress in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, the main
      hypothesis is to estimate whether the improvement in mental health is stronger during the
      first two weeks of applying the online support program as compared to a two weeks waiting
      condition (with provision of WHO information on 'coping with stress during the 2019-nCoV'
      outbreak only). Furthermore, our aim is to estimate changes in the outcomes along taking part
      in the program.

      Additional research questions are:

        -  to compare the intervention effects across modules and chapters of the online support
           program, including between module comparison with an unspecific, control (comparator)
           module: &quot;general information on the corona virus&quot; and its unspecific chapters;

        -  to estimate the effects of selected modules on additional outcomes (e.g. physical
           activity, and schooling related factors);

        -  to describe the magnitude and course of psychosocial stress, mental health and related
           factors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic;

        -  to estimate and predict which subjects profit most from specific parts of the program.

      Follow-up assessment shall allow estimating whether the program prevents the development of
      detrimental mental health conditions, e.g. depression, anxiety, etc.

All subjects in the waiting condition will undergo the intervention following the waiting period. Main assessments will be conducted before the waiting period, before beginning of the intervention, two weeks after beginning of the intervention (+2 weeks), +4 weeks, +12 weeks, and follow ups at +6 months and +12 months.</intervention_model_description>
