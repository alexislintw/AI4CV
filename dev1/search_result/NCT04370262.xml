  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study will be to evaluate the clinical efficacy of COVID-19
      treatments consisting of standard of care (SOC) combined with pharmaceutical antiviral
      management using hydroxychloroquine, or SOC with hydroxychloroquine combined with high-dose
      intravenous famotidine, in hospitalized patients meeting nucleic acid diagnostic and
      radiologic criteria for COVID-19 disease. The trial will statistically compare the clinical
      benefit afforded by the two treatment strategies to internal historical &quot;standard of care&quot;
      data from Northwell patents treated without benefit of either hydroxychloroquine or high-dose
      famotidine. We will compare clinical outcomes associated with hydroxychloroquine and the
      addition of high-dose intravascular famotidine. The trial is designed to enroll at least 600
      COVID-19 patients hospitalized with moderate to severe disease into each of the two active
      treatment arms, with a total enrollment target of at least 1200 patients. The proposed trial
      has been designed for rapid enrollment and completion and powered to support two interim
      analyses that will enable prompt assessment of benefits and risks of the two treatment groups
      while maintaining the rigorous gold standard of a randomized double blind clinical trial
      structure. Trial design has been guided by practical consideration of the current clinical
      context involving rapidly escalating demands on hospital staff and resources, and
      incorporates a minimalist approach employing existing laboratory information management
      systems and a clinically relevant binary primary outcome of 30-day endpoint of death or
      survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee identified an outbreak of viral
      pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in these patients.
      This novel coronavirus has been designated SARS-CoV-2, and the disease caused by this virus
      has been designated COVID-19 and has infected hundreds of thousands of confirmed individuals
      in more than 200 countries. Currently there are no approved therapeutic agents available for
      coronaviruses. There is an urgent need for an effective treatment to treat symptomatic
      patients but also to decrease the duration of virus transmission in the community. Among
      candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, repurposing of FDA-approved drugs for use as antiviral
      treatments is proposed because knowledge on safety profile, side effects, and drug
      interactions are well known. A clinical trial conducted in COVID-19 Chinese patients showed
      that chloroquine had a significant effect, both in terms of clinical outcome and viral
      clearance, when comparing to controls groups. Chinese experts recommend that patients
      diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and without
      contraindications to chloroquine, be treated with 500 mg chloroquine twice a day for ten
      days. Hydroxychloroquine (an analog of chloroquine) has been demonstrated to have an
      anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro. Hydroxychloroquine clinical safety profile is better than
      that of chloroquine (during long-term use) and allows higher daily dose and has fewer
      concerns about drug-drug interactions.

      Gautret recently reported a clinical trial to assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine and
      azithromycin on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in France. Early results, focusing on
      virological data in twenty patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infections
      receiving hydroxychloroquine as compared to a control group, showed a significant reduction
      of the viral carriage after 6 days of treatment compared to controls, and much lower average
      carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added
      to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. The molecular
      mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has not been fully elucidated but
      they are believed to change the pH at the surface of the cell membrane and thus, inhibit the
      fusion of the virus to the cell membrane, as well as inhibit nucleic acid replication,
      glycosylation of viral proteins, virus assembly, new virus particle transport, virus release
      and other processes to achieve its antiviral effects.

      Yao et.al recently reported antiviral and prophylactic activity of hydroxychloroquine and
      chloroquine in vitro, concluding that hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine at
      inhibiting SARS CoV 2 in vitro and that hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg given twice daily
      for day 1 (loading dose) followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4 more days is recommended to
      treat SARS CoV 2 infection.

      In silico screening of FDA licensed compound libraries against the SARS CoV 2 protease Plpro
      catalytic site was performed using solved crystal structures of the protein. Plpro
      (Papain-like protease) is an early acting protease responsible for initial processing of the
      SARS CoV2 polyprotein into active subunits. Plpro also has ubiquitinase activity, and is
      implicated in early infection phase inhibition of innate (interferon) immune responses which
      otherwise would suppress viral replication. A ranked list of licensed compounds with
      predicted binding activity in the Plpro catalytic site was computationally generated, and the
      Plpro catalytic site binding pose of each of the top compounds was examined and ranked by a
      team of pharmaceutical chemists. Package inserts or product monographs for the licensed
      compounds which generated high computational binding scores and passed inspection were then
      reviewed and used to rank compounds based on adverse events, warnings, drug interactions
      on-target mechanisms, pharmacokinetic and absorption, metabolism, excretion and toxicity
      (ADMET), protein binding and available therapeutic window considerations. Famotidine
      (Pepcid), a histamine H2 antagonist widely available over-the-counter, was repeatedly
      computationally scored among the highest of the compounds tested, and was associated with the
      most favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile. A series of analogs of famotidine were
      generated using PubChem, and many of these scored even higher as potential candidates. This
      control compound set further confirmed the predicted binding of the molecular backbone
      chemotype at the Plpro protease/ubiquitinase site. Currently available as oral and IV
      products, famotidine has a very attractive proven safety, drug interaction, and therapeutic
      window profile. Samples of famotidine have been submitted at Southern Research and IITRI for
      in vitro testing in COVID-19 cultures. Unpublished anecdotal case studies suggest clinical
      benefits associated with administration of famotidine 40 mg PO TID in mild COVID-19
      infection.

Famotidine Injection, 10mg/mL mixed with Normal Saline is given intravenously at 120mg (30% of 400 mg oral dose). The total daily dose proposed is 360mg/day famotidine IV for a maximum of 14 days, or hospital discharge, whichever comes first. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200mg tablets will be administered as per the current clinical protocol for COVID - 19; a loading dose of 400 mg BID on day 1, followed by 200 mg BID for 4 days, or a loading dose of 800 mg QD on day 1, followed by 400 mg QD for 4 days, as per site specific clinical protocol for COVID-19.</description>

    <description>In this trial, historical controls refer to hospitalized patients who were not treated with hydroxychloroquine or famotidine during the early stages of the pandemic, between February 1, 2020 and March 26, 2021. Since hydroxycholoroquine became the standard of care (SOC) treatment for COVID shortly after this time period, it would not be feasible or ethical to randomize patients in this trial to a control arm that excluded the use of any active investigational medications. This study will instead review data previously collected on patients not treated with HCQ to compare to the active treatment arms.</description>
