  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial that will be conducted in
      healthcare settings. After obtaining fully informed consent, the investigator will recruit
      healthcare workers in a healthcare facility delivering direct care to patients with either
      proven or suspected COVID-19, who can be followed reliably for up to 5 months. 40,000
      participants will be recruited and the investigators predict an average of 400-800
      participants per site in 50-100 sites.

      The participant will be randomised in Asia to receive either chloroquine or placebo (1:1
      randomisation) or in European and African sites, to receive hydroxychloroquine or placebo
      (1:1 randomisation). A loading dose of 10mg base/kg (four 155mg tablets for a 60kg subject),
      followed by 155 mg daily (250mg chloroquine phosphate salt/ 200mg hydroxychloroquine
      sulphate) will be taken for 90 days.

      If the participant is diagnosed with COVID-19, they will take continue to take the study
      medication unless advised to stop by their healthcare professional, or 90 days after
      enrolment, whichever is sooner.

      Episodes of symptomatic respiratory illness, including symptomatic COVID-19, and clinical
      outcomes will be recorded in the Case Record Form during the follow-up period.
