        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Sign the informed consent.

          2. Meet all current requirements to be a donor of apheresis plasma in accordance with
             European and Spanish regulations. (RD 1088/2005).

          3. Comply with the recommendations for obtaining plasma from convalescent donors of
             COVID-19 of the Scientific Committee for Transfusion Safety (CCST)

          4. Presence of detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in peripheral blood.

          5. Absence of symptoms by COVID19 in the last 14 days.

          6. Negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 PCR (in naso / oropharyngeal swab) in two tests with a
             minimum interval of 24/48 hours.

          7. ≥18 years of age at the time of donation.

          8. Weight&gt; 50 kg and good access to vein. Exceptions can be considered according to the
             criteria of the CTTC extractor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Plasmapheresis in the previous 7 days.

          2. Whole blood donation in the previous 30 days.

          3. Donation of more than 25 liters of plasma in the previous 12 months.

          4. In order to minimize the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), an
             additional relative exclusion criterion would be adopted for donors with a history of
             transfusion and women who are currently or previously pregnant. or have had abortions.
