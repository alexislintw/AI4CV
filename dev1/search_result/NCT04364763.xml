  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of a single dose
      of RBT-9 (Stannous protoporphyrin) versus placebo in preventing the progression of
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in non-critically ill adults who are at high
      risk due to age or comorbid conditions.
