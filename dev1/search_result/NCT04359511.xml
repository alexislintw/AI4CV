  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there is no efficient therapeutics to prevent or treat COVID-19 related pulmonary
      failure. Corticosteroids (CS) could be a helpful therapeutic. Retrospective reports suggested
      survival improvement in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CT scan for
      COVID19 hospitalized patients showed sometimes unusual aspects of pneumonia, suggestive of an
      organizing phase of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD).

      We hypothesize that, in the context of alveolar aggression induced by COVID-19, CT scan could
      help to individualize patients with a high probability of pulmonary organizing process who
      could benefit from CS treatment.
