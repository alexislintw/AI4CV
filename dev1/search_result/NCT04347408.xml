    <textblock>
      Very little is known regarding the symptoms and signs of Covid-19 disease in children. In
      particular it is not know how many children are asymptomatic carriers of the severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and what the symptoms and signs of mild
      Covid-19 disease are. There is a need to understand the pattern of immunological (e.g.
      cytokine) response is in children who experience mild versus severer disease. There is also
      need to develop a rapid accurate point of care (POC) test for SARS-CoV-2 virus. Currently
      there is an opportunity to complete this research rapidly in Northern Ireland and because the
      province is 2-3 weeks behind mainland United Kingdom (UK) in the development of the COVID-19
      epidemic and is ideally suited to this.

      In the midst of this rapidly evolving pandemic the RAPID-19 study is a pragmatic approach to
      addressing the above issues.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronaviruses are non-segmented positive-stranded RNA viruses with a roughly 30 kb genome
      (1). The majority of coronaviruses cause disease in a specific host species but some have
      infected humans by cross-species transmission. This process has led to a number of severe
      outbreaks of human disease including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 (1).

      From December 2019 a novel infection &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&quot;
      (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in the Wuhan region of China. The infection was identified as the
      causal factor in a growing number of severe cases of pneumonia (1). This disease was
      subsequently named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organisation (WHO).
      SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause severe disease similar to the previous SARS coronavirus
      from 2003. Severe disease is associated with pneumonia and damage to vital organs including
      lung, heart, liver, and kidney (1). Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children
      worldwide but very little is known regarding the disease process in children.

        -  Currently it is not known why so many children exhibit mild disease, or why some
           children suffer severe disease and die.

        -  There is a need for an accurate rapid point of care diagnostic test to diagnose
           SARS-CoV-2 infection (the cause of COVID-19).

      Point-of-care (POC) testing:

      A rapid POC test for SARS-CoV-2 is essential. With such a potentially fatal disease
      confirming the diagnosis early will allow for prompt and appropriate therapy. A rapid test
      would also allow for early cohorting of children thereby improving flow through the emergency
      department. Finally rapid testing could support the wider fight against Covid-19 through
      quicker contact tracing and isolation.

      The research team in Belfast have experience of using Loop-mediated isothermal AMPlification
      (LAMP) for the rapid diagnosis of serious infections in children and have been involved with
      the development of LAMP testing for Meningococcal Disease, invasive E.coli infection Group B
      Streptococcal disease (2,-4). There now exists a CE marked commercially available LAMP rapid
      test for SARS-CoV-2 that can be performed with minimal equipment within 30 minutes. The test
      can be performed using a single throat or nasal swab.

      Disease process:

      Very little is known regarding the symptoms and signs of Covid-19 disease in children (1). In
      particular, it is not know how many children are asymptomatic carriers of the SARS-CoV-2
      virus and what the symptoms and signs of mild Covid-19 disease are. It is also not know why
      some, previously well, children develop severe disease. Research is required to understand
      the symptoms and signs of infection, the spectrum of disease and the host immune response in
      those with severe disease.

      Rationale for the study:

      This RAPID-19study aims to improve our understanding of how Covid-19 affects healthy
      children. By following children of healthcare workers there is an opportunity to follow
      children as they acquire Covid-19 and develop immunity. During this time the performance of
      antibody tests and rapid diagnostics will be assessed. These tests are vital in the fight
      against Covid-19. The study population was chosen as healthcare workers are at higher risk of
      contracting the infection during the current social distancing measures.

      In addition to the main cohort (children of healthcare workers), the study will recruit
      children with known Covid-19 admitted to hospital. Severe disease is likely to be a rare
      event and admission to hospital will be an uncommon event for most children with Covid-19. It
      is estimated that only 1 or 2 children of the (100-120) healthcare workers will be admitted
      for treatment. By following admitted children there is an opportunity to research the full
      spectrum of disease from minor illness through to moderate and severe disease. By following a
      range of severities it will be possible to gain a greater insight into the different cytokine
      proteomic, and transcriptomic responses. This will provide insight into prognostication and
      potential therapeutics.
