  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research proposes to study a large healthy population active for the presence of
      antibodies directed against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      virus and this over time.

      After verification of the inclusion criteria and information by the coordinating
      investigative doctor, the volunteers sign a written consent. A nurse will take blood samples
      under safe conditions compatible with the pandemic period and while respecting the protection
      of the volunteer's personal data.

      The blood samples will be taken at 4 times: T0 (day of inclusion), 1 month, 3 months and 6
      months' post-inclusion.

      Each blood sample consists of a collection of 5 mL of blood in a dry tube. The serum samples
      will be extracted and collected prospectively from the blood samples. A questionnaire will be
      completed by the inclusion volunteer (T0) in the study then 1, 3 and 6 months'
      post-inclusion.
