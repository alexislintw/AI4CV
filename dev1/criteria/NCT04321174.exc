          1. Known hypersensitivity/allergy to lopinavir or ritonavir.

          2. Current use of LPV/r for the treatment or prevention of HIV infection.

          3. Receipt of LPV/r in the context of this trial or any other trial of COVID-19 PEP
             within 2 days or less prior to the last known contact with the index COVID-19 case.
             The two day time window is intended to ensure that exposure would not have occurred in
             the presence of clinically relevant drug levels (five times the elimination half-life
             of LPV/r, which is estimated at 4-6 hours with prolonged use).

          4. Baseline respiratory tract specimen positive for COVID-19. Randomized participants
             whose baseline samples subsequently show COVID-19 will have study drug discontinued
             but still remain under observation.

          5. Current breastfeeding, due to potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing
             infants exposed to LPV/r

          6. Concomitant medications with prohibited drug interactions with LPV/r that cannot be
             temporarily suspended/replaced, including but not restricted to: 37
