          1. Participation in any other clinical trial of an experimental treatment for COVID-19.

          2. Concurrent treatment with other agents with actual or possible direct acting antiviral
             activity against SARS-CoV-2 is prohibited < 24 hours prior to study drug dosing,
             except the commonly used antiviral drugs and/or chloroquine.

          3. Requiring endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane
             oxygenation (ECMO) at screening.

          4. Patients being treated with immunomodulators or anti-rejection drugs.

          5. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 5 x upper limit
             of normal (ULN).

          6. Creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min.

          7. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or end-stage lung disease that require
             home oxygen therapy.

          8. Known hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins, or any excipient contained in the drug
             formulation of study pembrolizumab and tocilizumab.

          9. Treatment with high doses of systemic corticosteroids within 72 hours prior signing
             the ICF except for inhaled steroids and prior corticosteroid therapy at dose lower
             than or equal to 10 mg/day methylprednisolone equivalent.

         10. Bowel diverticulitis or perforation.

         11. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency receiving immunosuppressive therapy within seven days
             prior to study treatment initiation. Active autoimmune disease that has required
             systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents,
             corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs).

         12. Current known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus
             (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients with past HBV infection or resolved HBV
             infection (defined as having a negative hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] test and a
             positive hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] test, accompanied by a negative HBV DNA
             test) are eligible. Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase
             chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA).

         13. Vaccination with any live virus vaccine within 28 days prior to study treatment
             initiation.

             Note: Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following:
             measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Gurin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are live-attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

         14. History of prior allogeneic bone marrow, stem-cell, or solid organ transplantation.

         15. Patients have any other concurrent severe medical condition that would, in the
             Investigator's judgment contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study.

         16. Pregnant women, lactating women and planned pregnant women.
